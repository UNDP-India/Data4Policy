# Soil Organic Carbon

Soil organic carbon (SOC) refers only to the carbon component of organic compounds.<br>
Sequestering carbon in SOC has been suggested as one way to mitigate climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide.<br>
The argument is that small increases of SOC over very large areas in agricultural and pastoral lands will significantly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.<br>
SOC is crucial to soil health, fertility and ecosystem services, including food production – making its preservation and restoration essential for sustainable development.<br><br>

## Types of Soil Organic Carbon data

### Products:
Soil Organic Carbon Content (dg/kg)<br>
Soil Organic Carbon Density (g/dm3)<br>
Soil Organic Carbon stock (tonnes/ha)<br>
<br>
### Depths:
0-5cm<br>
5-15cm<br>
15-30cm<br>
30-60cm<br>
60-100cm<br>
100-200cm<br>
<br>

## Issue!
The Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks in SoilGrids 2020 were obtained with a calculate first interpolate later approach. The SOC stocks in SoilGrids version 2017 were obtained with a interpolate first calculate later approach, where the stocks were calculated from the maps of the input properties. So instead of having data of different years, soilgrids are "improved" product from 2017 to 2020. <br><br>

## Soil Organic Carbon Driving Factors

Terrain Factor: levation, slope gradient slope position, slope direction, rock coverage, soil thickness<br>
Soil physical index : Gavel content, soil bulk density soil water content<br>
Soil chemical index: Total N, total P, total K, effective P, quick available K, soil C/N, soil pH<br>
Applying organic fertilizer, Applying Nitrogenous fertilizer, Applying phosphate fertilizer Applying potash fertilizer <br>
stubble, straw returning, Straw yield<br>
