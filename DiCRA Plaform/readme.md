# About DiCRA

Data in Climate Resilient Agriculture (DiCRA) is a collaborative digital public good which provides open access to key geospatial datasets pertinent to climate resilient agriculture. These datasets are curated and validated through collaborative efforts of hundreds of data scientists and citizen scientists across the world. The pattern detection and data insights emerging from DiCRA are aimed towards strengthening evidence-driven policy making for climate resilient food systems. DiCRA is guided by the digital public good principles of open access, open software, open code and open APIs.
