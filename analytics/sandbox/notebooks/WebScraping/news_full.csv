"Delhi choking, but do not blame stubble burning alone","December 07, 2022 12:08 am | Updated 01:06 pm IST

Every year around Deepavali, and like clockwork, Delhi’s air quality makes it to the headlines. But there is a problem. You would have noticed that the noise on TV channels and even newspapers over the issue dies down after one ‘strong wind speed day’ and blows the debate away. Next winter we are back to expressing outrage again. As firefighters we are doing well, but as planners doing very little. While nature will not change, emissions can be reduced.

Increasingly polluted air is a hazard and a health crisis in the making. In fact, it is already one. India now reports 2.5 million air pollution-related deaths annually. Pollution not only makes our throats and eyes burn but is much more insidious. Some pollutants are so small that they are able to enter the bloodstream with ease, impacting almost every organ in the body and leading to the onset of health issues such as stroke, heart diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer, to name just a few serious health problems. It is not just about good air. It is about life.

While a lot has been written and said about Delhi’s air quality, the question that still has to be answered is this: why is nothing changing after all these years?

The same orders again

A principal reason is that year after year, we are doing the same things to try and address the problem without actually trying to evaluate why those measures are not effective. The Government formed the Commission for Air Quality Management, which, unfortunately, did not offer anything new. This body essentially issued the same orders the Ministry and the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority used to, with just a slight change in the language used. Every year schools are closed, people are advised to to stay indoors, or carpool and work from home, bans on firecrackers are reinforced, construction stopped, trucks and cars not allowed to enter the city, and industries running on fuel shut. These measures, and several others, are akin to dressing a bullet wound with bandaid. Stopping people from going about their regular work is plain bad governance.

Why Delhi’s air is bad

As the haze descends over Delhi, the blamegame begins — with stubble burning in the neighbouring States being identified as the main culprit. However, the reality is that Delhi’s air is bad even when stubble is not being burnt. The burning of biomass in and around Delhi, if audited properly, would be the same as stubble burning in other States. Unfortunately none of the bodies, be it the municipal body or the government’s Public Works Department, is willing to take responsibility for this or address and find a solution to the problem. This is not to say that stubble burning is not a problem. Some solutions have been tried out over the years, but with little success. What is required is a fundamental shift in agricultural patterns, which needs someone to make a bold political call. Unless farmers are adequately compensated, the problem is unlikely to go away. The ‘Happy Seeder’-based solution has sadly not been a happy experience. We need to acknowledge that the problem is not just Delhi-centric. For some strange reason we all talk about the airshed approach but do not spend the rest of the year trying to solve the problem. Delhi chokes on its own dust and industrial activities. Who is ensuring compliance with the rules relating to the handling of construction and demolition waste? Delhi started with much enthusiasm about roadside greening and cover. But is anyone monitoring this? Everyone seems to be looking at the data of PNG in industry, but is anyone looking at the unauthorised industries, which are a large emitter? Vehicles are another source of pollution in the city and we need to introspect why, despite an expanding fleet of public transport, citizens who primarily use two-wheelers have not moved to using the public transport system — buses and the metro. I feel the reasons for this include last-mile connectivity, the problem of crowding in buses and metros, and the inability to reach and navigate narrow lanes that two-wheelers can. The state of maintenance of buses could be another reason as well.

A no to silo functioning

We have to be creative and look beyond the measures that have already been tried and proved they are at best a short-term solution to a recurring, long-term problem. Even then a core issue that needs to be addressed is the governance system. There needs to be a single entity that takes responsibility for air quality management. We cannot operate in silos where one system of governance is responsible for thinking, a second issues orders and a third is responsible for implementation. Without an efficient system that works in a coordinated way, we will find ourselves to be in the same position years later.

The reality also is that Delhi is not the sole offender. There are many other cities in India where safe levels of air quality are breached regularly. Air quality is a problem on most days but becomes an issue around Deepavali and when stubble is being burnt. We need to take more comprehensive, long-term measures throughout the year and not just in the days and weeks when it begins to make news.

Collaborative state can curb north India’s stubble burning,"On the eve of Diwali and the day after the festival, air quality ""only"" dropped to ""very poor"" instead of ""hazardous"", which is a small victory and mercy over the consistent environmental onslaught of the last decade.

On October 17, the Central government's Commission of Air Quality Management issued a statement, based on IARI analysis of NASA data, that paddy stubble burning incidents have reduced between September 15 to October 16 -- from 2,375 in 2021 to 1,444 in 2022 in Punjab and from 1,026 in 2021 to 244 in 2022 in Haryana. All of this could be attributed to better governance and PUSA decomposer spraying but is more likely a function of the asynchronous Diwali-crop season, extended monsoon, heavy unseasonal rainfall and marginal bureaucratic improvements.

Regardless of reduction in stubble burning incidents, Delhi’s air pollution will worsen over the next few weeks as we enter the dry winter, festival season and the farmers’ dire need to plant wheat and vegetables. The most important and powerful first responder will be the state comprising the legislature, democratic and bureaucratic executive and judiciary. It is the most influential lever of social change and can use persuasion, regulation, coercion and action. What can it do better this time?

Stubble burning and air quality has gone from bad to worse because of lack of public buy-in, absence of political will, lack of a stable policy ecosystem that promotes entrepreneurship for public problem solving and fragmented bureaucratic actions organized by departments instead of outcome. There is an underdeveloped research ecosystem for innovation and low coordination between judges, scientists and businesses, causing great public harm. The solution lies in dialogue on war-footing instead of monologues on the back-burner, where Occam’s razor takes precedence of Hanlon’s razor.

First, the Judiciary. The Supreme Court, National Green Tribunal and High Courts of north India can do citizens a great service by bringing scientific rigour, business viability and market sustainability as the central pivot for problem-solving. In an age where the judiciary is known for executive action, it can replicate its experiences from Covid-19, where industry was a key stakeholder in problem solving with vaccines (Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute) and oxygen (Inox, Linde) whilst renowned academics and doctors were consulted to understanding the multi-dimensional problem directly.

Similarly, for the respiratory crisis that is air pollution, the courts should consult public sector research organisations (IIT Delhi, IISc Bangalore, CSIR) and private think tanks (WRI, Clean Air Fund, Open Philanthropies) on air quality directly to solve this crisis created by misaligned incentives and improper policy design. This will help create concrete and implementable plans instead of promoting unscientific, cost-ineffective or unsustainable solutions like smog towers and mechanised sweeping. The current Chief Justice Uday Umesh Lalit, who has been amicus curiae in several pollution cases, and is in office till November 10, will spend his last few weeks in Delhi’s toxic air. He has the opportunity to leave a lasting legacy on north India’s air quality if he were able to create a systematic, sustainable and scientific plan to monitor and evaluate solutions proposed in several orders of Supreme Court Writ Petition 13029.

Second, the government (and the legislature). Governments must find a way to implement multi-pronged solutions in an outcome-oriented manner, to treat the fundamental ailment, instead of treating the symptoms. North India’s executive-led legislatures, for example, must reconsider the legislative instruments (Preservation of Subsoil Water Acts) enacted in 2009, aimed at water conservation in Punjab and Haryana, which gave the government the power to define a precise date of the year before which farmers are prohibited from transplanting paddy. While seeking to reduce groundwater depletion, it has reduced the number of days available between the kharif and rabi crops, and created incentives to burn the stubble in order to rapidly clear the field. Each year over the last 13 years, the agrarian crisis gets worse through bad policy planning and implementation, leading to poor fertilizers, failing crops and falling incomes. Free electricity for agricultural pumps without boundary conditions or community disincentives, and excessive continuous reliance on paddy due to its MSP and history has made things worse for water, soil, crops, farmers and the state.

To solve for this Nemean Hydra, groundwater depletion needs to be tackled by creating ponds, rejuvenating lakes and cleaning rivers using natural treatment methods and people’s participation. Delhi’s model of lake rejuvenation and Sant Balbir Seechewal’s model of cleaning the Kali Bein rivulet can be mainstreamed inside the government to bring science and community together. A new model of agrarian electricity governance should be proposed that provides for two lines to be connected to each village, one for agricultural use and one for residential use. The village residential line, with 24 hours of electricity, can power homes. Free but metered and scheduled electricity can be provided for agricultural pumps for a few hours in a day on the agricultural line. These two lines should have strict usage norms with village-level disincentives and individual fines if abused. Simultaneously, the long-term policy and program on crop diversification to increase farmer incomes must be pursued with vigor, which can create a sustainable market in the agrarian economy that removes the need for coercive laws. This means promoting millets and mushrooms which are less water intensive through state policies and instruments like MSP, as also creating a market for green business alternatives for paddy straw through mulching, green energy, eco-cutlery, eco-friendly housing and composting to supplement farmer incomes by creating value from waste. All these executive programs would benefit immensely if individual legislators showed greater agency to bring executive projects and practices to fruition and success.

And finally, the bureaucracy. The iron frame of the bureaucracy has the scope for highest impact because they can work in the background and apolitically implement best practices from within and outside their state. District magistrates in Punjab and Haryana can learn from Pathankot, which was able to reduce farmer apprehension in using stubble as fodder for cattle by sharing best practices, innovative communication and creating market linkages between agriculturists and dairy farmers. In 2019, this led to no stubble fires in the district. Similarly, they could replicate and scale the prudent and practical work of the Kheti Virasat Mission on crop diversification conducted by them in Faridkot, in their own district. They could emulate Chhattisgarh’s Gauthan model of allowing composting on a 5-acre patch of barren land that enables social entrepreneurs and cooperatives to localise production and distribution of fertilizers using stubble as an input, again generating local value from local waste.

Senior bureaucrats in the government of India and state governments can connect disconnected silos of funds, plans and mandates to align disparate functions with common outcomes. If coordinated well, the Finance Commission grants for stubble burning reduction, pollution cess in states, CSR donations of private companies and philanthropic donations could be mobilized rapidly into a common air quality emergency fund to implement innovative solutions at scale. For example, it could use granular and fidelitous satellite data to implement outcome-driven payment of incentives to farmers and villages that don’t indulge in stubble burning. It could bring to life and catalyse existing central and state government mandates of using biomass, for fuelling power plants and industrial boilers, instead of coal that is currently prevented by organisational inertia and viability gap funding for decentralised or local solutions.

Public problem solving requires participation and action from private markets, civil society and academia. Science can frame and measure the problem better and with its help technology can expand the scope of potential solutions. Companies, CSR and philanthropies can bring rapid scale, viability and sustainability to these solutions. Civil society activists and citizens can bring individual and collective action in implementing these solutions with tenacity and passion. However, for that, the state must understand that it can’t solve this problem by itself. It can get by with a little help from its friends. Collaboration with competence with a base layer of compassion might be the only way that we can collectively breathe easy.

Later, he held deliberations with his Delhi’s counterpart Gopal Roy. He said this project would be done jointly by the governments of both states.

The minister said under the process, Pusa bio-decomposer will be sprayed on the stubble following which the stubble gets mixed in the soil hence the farmers will not need to burn the stubble./

Stubble burning not ‘political issue: Tomar,"New Delhi: Amid rising air pollution in the national capital, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday expressed concerns over politics being played on the stubble burning issue and urged Delhi as well as neighbouring states to take steps to curb the menace.

There is more discussion on “politics” surrounding stubble burning than its impact on land and what steps farmers should take to curb it, Tomar said.

He also rued that stubble burning incidents are rising despite the Centre providing crores of funds and machines to tackle the problem, saying it is definitely a cause of concern.

At an event here, Tomar appealed to four state governments — Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi — to take steps to control stubble burning by making use of available solutions such as Pusa decomposer, a bio-decomposer technique that converts stubble into compost much faster than usual.

Last week, the minister held a review meeting with state government officials concerned on the stubble burning situation which has resulted in severe pollution in the national capital.

Tomar also said that he is ready to meet chief ministers of respective states in case they want to have further discussions on the issue.

While addressing the day-long event on ‘Pusa decomposer’, Tomar said that ever since stubble burning has become a major issue, the Centre, states, and judiciary have taken note of it, and schemes also have been implemented to deal with the menace.

Pusa decomposer, developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), is cheaper and easier to use. It not only controls stubble burning but also improves the soil fertility and productivity of soil, he added.

Every year, stubble burning in neighbouring states during the paddy harvesting season contributes significantly to air pollution in the national capital and northern India.

For management of stubble, the Centre has provided Rs 3,138 crore to four states since 2018-19 and 2 lakh machines have been made available to them. Out of the total amount, more than Rs 1,400 crore has been given to Punjab, Rs 900 crore to Haryana, Rs 713 crore to Uttar Pradesh and Rs 6-7 crore to Delhi, Tomar said.

“If those machines (like Happy seeder, a tractor mounted machine that cuts and lifts rice straw and sows wheat into the soil, and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch) are put to use fully, there won’t be a problem. If states want to control it, then the answer lies in using whatever solutions are available at present,” he said.

Asserting that Pusa decomposer is a successful technique for decomposing the stubble, the minister said, “It is cheaper and easier to use. Farmers have used it. Decomposer will not only control stubble burning but improve soil fertility.”

Some states, especially Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, have done good work and are moving towards a positive direction, he added.

“About 2 lakh machines have been purchased through states… if a state is determined, it can control stubble burning,” Tomar told reporters on the sidelines of the event.

As agriculture minister, Tomar said he feels bad when farmers are blamed for the rise in pollution in Delhi.

“I am agriculture minister and represent the farming community. If pollution in Delhi rises due to farmers, I feel they are blaming me. It is everyone’s responsibility to get rid of this stigma on farmers,” he said.

He emphasised that stubble burning is not a “political issue,” it is affecting both soil and air. But there is more debate on “politics” than its impact on the environment.

“In the evening those not concerned with the topic debate on the issue without any logic. Usually, the discussion is not on what farmers should do to address this problem,” he said.

He said that paddy is grown and machines are used for harvesting, which results in huge quantities of stubble. “The discussion is necessary on how to manage this stubble and what steps farmers, scientists and the governments should take”.

Agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said, “stubble burning has posed a big challenge before us and we have to address this at the earliest. About 55 per cent stubble burning happens in Punjab while rest in Delhi, Haryana and very less in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.”

In Punjab, farmers burn the paddy stubble as they have less time for planting wheat. Several steps have been taken to promote short duration paddy varieties that can be harvested in 135-145 days instead of 165 days of present paddy variety, he said.

About two lakh machines like ‘Happy seeder’ and ‘Smart seeder’ have been made available to the farmers and even Pusa decomposer is successful in converting the stubble into compost, he said, and urged farmers and states to use the available solutions to address the problem of stubble burning.",['Press Trust Of India'],2022-11-04 17:13:05+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Narendra-Singh-Tomar-nov4-.jpg,[],[],,[],[]

Will take 4-5 years to properly resolve stubble burning issue: Punjab pollution control body,"October 04, 2022 12:31 pm | Updated 12:38 pm IST - New Delhi

Crop diversification is not a long-term solution to the problem of stubble burning and it will take four to five years to properly resolve the issue, a senior official of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has said.

Crop diversification and using short duration varieties of paddy are among several initiatives proposed by the Centre and experts to resolve the stubble burning issue in Punjab and Haryana.

At a workshop organised by the Delhi-based Climate Trends in Chandigarh on Monday, PPCB Member Secretary Krunesh Garg said counting the number of farm fires is an inaccurate measure of ascertaining the scale of stubble burning and that the acreage of land being put on fire is the parameter to be measured.

“It's not that the problem is not being addressed, we are mapping it down to the block and village level, but it will take four-five years for proper resolution,"" Mr. Garg said.

The area under paddy cultivation in Punjab has increased from 29.61 lakh hectares in last year to 31.13 lakh hectares this year. This would result in the generation of 19.76 million ton of paddy straw this year as compared to 18.74 MT last year.

“Crop diversification is not a long-term solution because it does not mean that biomass will not be produced by other crops. It will just be another kind of biomass waste, like cotton sticks, mustard straw waste etc.

""Issues with respect to (stubble) burning will always remain. So, we need to find solutions, both in situ and ex-situ. A combination of these can only be effective,” Mr. Garg said.

Dr Adarsh Pal Vig, Chairman, Punjab Pollution Control Board said, “It is a social and a psychological problem where behaviour and attitude of farmers also needs to be addressed."" He said urbanisation and the exploding population in cities are causing a problem. Due to such factors, big cities like Delhi are already sitting on a tipping point and stubble becomes the last straw every season.

"Antimicrobial resistance: India needs waste management, process control to prevent antibiotic pollution","Manufacturing process needs control measures; 43% of world’s rivers contaminated with active pharmaceutical ingredients

The domestic pharmaceutical industry needs to take the lead in limiting antibiotic pollution — one of the biggest problems the world is staring at.

Almost half, or 43 per cent, of the world’s rivers are contaminated with active pharmaceutical ingredients in concentrations that can have disastrous ramifications on health. The industry must prioritise wastewater management and process controls to limit antibiotic pollution and AMR.

There is widespread acknowledgement of the interconnectivity between humans, animals, and the environmental ecosystem. But unsustainable development patterns due to anthropological activities continue to usher in a climate crisis that has far-reaching consequences.

The interdependence between human and animal health was first recognised in 1856 by Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern medicine. World leaders later put it together to form the Manhattan Principles that formed the basis of the One Health concept.

The recently adopted Glasgow Climate Pact has called upon countries to facilitate the adoption of greener technologies to phase out the use of fossil fuels. The development and deployment of such technologies is also critical for the pharmaceutical sector that has formed the backbone of the growth of many economies including India.

While the sector plays a fundamental role in improving health outcomes through the invention of life-saving products, its emission intensity is 55 per cent more than the automotive sector.

The release of untreated effluents into the soil and water bodies add to the pollution of the environment during the manufacturing of various pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics. Further, untreated antibiotic residues also accelerate the build-up of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

AMR is often dubbed as one of the top 10 public health threats facing humanity. It occurs when disease-causing pathogens develop a resistance against the pharmaceuticals that could have neutralised them.

The build-up of AMR can happen due to several factors across the human, animal, and environmental ecosystems. In 2019, AMR accounted for more than half a million deaths in the European region and about five million globally.

Pivoting to sustainable waste management and process-control practices assumes acute significance in the Indian context. India already accounts for 20 per cent of the global supply of medication, making it the largest supplier of generic medicines worldwide.

India’s production capacity is all set to expand further with the government’s recent impetus on the domestic production of pharmaceuticals. Against this background, the country’s National Action Plan on AMR (NAP-AMR) called for limiting pharmaceutical pollution.

Strategic Pillars 2 and 3 under the NAP-AMR focused on developing frameworks for the surveillance of residues discharged in the environment and developing a plan to reduce the environmental impact on AMR, respectively. However, this policy impetus is yet to translate into on-ground implementation.

Recently, widescale pharmaceutical pollution has been reported across the country, particularly in pharmaceutical hubs like Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. This was also reiterated by a study that reported dangerous levels of antibiotic residues in Indian rivers.

Apart from government regulation, there is a need for the domestic Indian pharmaceutical industry to optimise its waste management and process control to limit the rising antibiotic pollution in the country. Adopting innovative technology and self-regulation can help the industry reduce its carbon footprint and minimise its environmental impact.

The former is also evident from Centrient Pharmaceuticals Netherlands BV’s plant at Toansa, Punjab, where the adoption of state-of-art API technology led to a 60-62 per cent reduction in the plant’s carbon footprint.

The AMR Industry Alliance (AMRIA) has developed the Predicted No-Effect Concentrations (PNEC) criteria further to facilitate the industry in regulating its discharge of effluents. The compliance to PNEC value for Centrient’s oral API product line and supply chain has helped the company reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing.

Additionally, the efforts of the industry must be supported by the government by incentivising sustainable procurement practices. The government can take a cue from countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and Germany, among others, which have policies in place that provide benefits to manufacturers with greener practices.

Adherence to these practices will also prevent the Indian pharmaceutical industry from losing its competitive advantage in export markets.

The containment of AMR in India is crucial for realising several policy goals, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

While collective action is needed from various stakeholders, the domestic pharmaceutical industry should also take the lead, especially in limiting antibiotic pollution.

AMR is everybody’s problem and in line with the theme of the seventh World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, I would like to urge the policymakers, academia, healthcare experts, industry, environmentalists and the government to join hands and prevent the silent pandemic of AMR.

Summer fire activities thrice than winter months in 2021,"Punjab, Haryana recorded close to 23,000 cases of farm fires from March 1-May 11, 2022

By Pulaha Roy

Stubble burning, considered one of the driving factors of north India’s winter pollution, has reared its head in the middle of summer. Satellite images have picked up a large concentration of farm fire incidents in the country’s north.

Satelites could spot a total of 9,874 fire activities across India (7,429) and Pakistan (2,445) from May 9-May 10, 2022.

Forest fires peak in India during March and April, according to historical data. In 2021, data showed that fire activities in the months of March and April were three times more than what it was during October, November and December.

But fire activities during summer don't feature much in the discussion.

Across the Indian subcontinent, fire activities detected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) showed fire activities across the Punjab province in Pakistan as well as in India, while Haryana also witnessed fire instances in the 24-hour period.

Isolated pockets of fire activities were also scattered across India as seen in the map.

The next big fire hotspot in the subcontinent was the forested regions criss-crossing the borders of Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and parts of Telangana. Various national parks and wildlife sanctuaries —like the Papikonda National Park in Andhra Pradesh and wild buffalo sanctuary at Pamed in Chhattisgarh — span across borders of the four states.

But the talk around fire activities revolves mostly around stubble burning across north India, specifically Punjab and Haryana. FIRMS data on fire activities in India for 2021, however, showed that in the months of March and April, overall count was just a little over three times of what one experienced in the months of October, November and December combined.

In 2021, there were a total of 760,000 instances of fire activities detected by NASA’s ​​Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite, with just over 60 per cent of the burning happening in just the two months of March and April.

But how do we know if it's forest fire or fire from stubble burning?

VIIRS, which was modelled on another NASA product MODIS, detects fire activities through heat sensors whenever the temperature exceeds 815 degrees Celsius — the temperature required for an established wildfire to burn.

But, even then, there is no way of telling what is what — whether the wildfire is actually man-made like stubble fire burning or forest fire which gets ignited because of high temperatures and dry conditions.

Down To Earth extrapolated data of fire incidents, as well as vegetation as well as forest cover from two different datasets. The darker shade of green indicates forest cover, while a lighter shade indicates local vegetation cover like farmlands, shrubs and bushes.

From the image processed, it can be ascertained that stubble fire activities are underway in the states of Punjab on both sides of the border, as well in the state of Haryana in India.

In 2021, Haryana and Punjab reported over 15,000 instances of stubble burning from March 1 to May 11, VIIRS data showed. In 2022, the figure rose to almost 23,000.

Further south of the country, in the border regions of Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and parts of Telangana, fire spots detected by VIIRS were triggered because of a forest fire.

Why no one’s talking about fire summer activities

Discussions around fire activities generally revolve around stubble burning that impacts air quality across the northwestern regions of the subcontinent and the Indo-Gangetic plains.

But, a more granular-analysis of the fire data showed the bulk of the activities peak in the summer months mostly triggered by forest fires instead of stubble fires.

With the world warming at a faster rate, currently at 1.1°C over pre-industrial levels, irrespective of whether it be forest fire or stubble burning, high temperatures and dry conditions due to climate change is only exacerbating the situation.",[],None,https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-05-12/0.19993500_1652336493_india_firepoints-01-(1).png,[],[],,[],[]
"Delhi govt. to spray bio-decomposer solution over paddy fields to check stubble burning, winter pollution","September 21, 2022 01:47 am | Updated 01:47 am IST - New Delhi

:

To control stubble burning and reduce air pollution during winter, the Delhi government will spray a bio-decomposer free of cost over 5,000 acres of paddy fields in the city this year, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Tuesday.

A bio-decomposer capsule, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, turns into a solution through a week-long process, after which it decomposes straw and stubble into manure.

Positive results

The Delhi government first used the solution in 2020 and then again in the following year. On both occasions, the government claimed to have achieved positive results.

To spray the bio-decomposer solution, Mr. Rai said, 21 teams have been formed, which include officials of the Agriculture and Revenue Departments.

“The bio-decomposer will be sprayed for free by the government in all the Basmati and non-Basmati paddy farms in Delhi,” the Minister added.

The bio-decomposer solution is one of the 15 focus points in the government’s Winter Action Plan, which will be released later this month. The Minister said this year the bio-decomposer has also been provided in the form of a powder and the government plans to use it on 1,000 acres on a trial basis.

“We received a very positive result last year. The stubble decomposed properly. Moreover, there was an increase in the fertility of the soil,” Mr. Rai said. The teams responsible will start spraying the bio-decomposer solution from the first week of October, Mr. Rai said.

Fighting pollution

Every winter air pollution spikes in the national capital and adjoining areas due to multiple reasons, including slow wind speed, bursting of firecrackers and pollution from stubble burning.

A list of emergency measures to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR, such as closing schools and stopping construction work, are undertaken each year during the winter months.

As per the latest Graded Response Action Plan, prepared by the Commission for Air Quality Management, emergency measures will now be implemented based on predictions on air quality, three days in advance.",[],2022-09-20 20:17:32+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/wosadx/article65915726.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/6270_23_10_2021_15_52_22_4_DSC1876_9.JPG,[],[],,[],[]
Blame for stubble burning in Punjab rests with Centre: Rai,"October 22, 2022 12:54 am | Updated 12:54 am IST - New Delhi

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday said the Centre’s “blunt” refusal to provide cash incentives to Punjab farmers to avoid stubble burning “has impacted the entire campaign [against stubble burning] in the State”.

Speaking at a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Rai said the Punjab government had come up with a plan to provide financial assistance of ₹2,500 per acre to its farmers to dispose of crop residues without harming the environment.

The proposal

“The farmers had demanded financial support [for not burning stubble]. The State government then prepared a proposal stating that [the governments of] Delhi and Punjab would give ₹500 each with the Centre contributing the remaining ₹1,500,” said Mr. Rai.

“However, the way the Centre has bluntly denied [the request]... it has impacted the entire campaign [against stubble burning] in the State. But the Punjab government is conducting awareness campaigns and we hope that there will be fewer fire events this year compared with last year. There would have been a big impact [on stubble burning] had the Centre provided support,” he also said.

‘Did nothing’

Hitting back, BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that despite being in power in both the States, AAP “has done nothing” about the problem of stubble burning and has instead “tried to pass the buck to the Centre in the name of this proposal”.

According to Punjab government officials, the Centre rejected the proposal saying it has been providing subsidised machinery, such as happy seeders, rotavators and mulchers, to the State’s farmers for the in situ management of paddy straw.

Mr. Rai said that the proposal was conceived after the Punjab government officials held exhaustive consultations with the State’s farmers, who had asked for a cash incentive to help them cover the cost of fuel used in operating the machinery for the in situ management (mixing crop residue in soil) of paddy straw.

The proposal was then sent to the Centre and the Commission for Air Quality Management in July, he added.

"Delhi air in ‘very poor’ zone, stubble burning share rises to 26%","New Delhi: Delhi’s air quality was in the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday and deteriorated to the ‘severe category’ in some areas, with forecasters saying that slow wind speed and an increase in stubble burning, especially in Punjab, may make it worse.

The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution rose to 26 percent on Sunday, the highest this year.

Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) stood at 367 at 9 am and it improved to 352 at 4 pm.

The 24-hour average AQI on Saturday was 397, the worst since January. It was 354 on Thursday, 271 on Wednesday, 302 on Tuesday and 312 on Monday (Diwali).

On Sunday, Anand Vihar (AQI 449) was the most polluted place in the capital, followed by Vivek Vihar (402).

Environment Minister Gopal Rai said Anand Vihar and Vivek Vihar have been reporting high pollution levels continuously which could be due to construction work related to Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS).

“Therefore, we have directed the user agency to strictly follow the dust pollution control norms. The government has deployed 15 anti-smog guns in those areas in addition to seven water sprinklers of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi,” he said.

“Diesel-run buses have an important role in high pollution levels at the Delhi-UP border. We request the UP government to run CNG buses in the NCR districts at least. This will help bring down air pollution,” the minister said.

Stubble burning accounted for 26 percent of the PM2.5 pollution in Delhi on Sunday and forecasters said it is likely to rise in the coming days.

The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) reported 1,761 farm fires in Punjab on Sunday, 1,898 on Saturday, 2,067 – the highest so far this season – on Friday and 1,111 on Thursday. It logged 112 and 43 cases of stubble burning in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, on Sunday.

The Commission for Air Quality Management had on Thursday said the increased incidents of stubble burning in Punjab this year “is a matter of serious concern”.

According to satellite remote sensing data, up to October 24, only about 39 per cent of the sown area in Punjab had been harvested and thus the rising number of fire events was an alarming situation, it said.

With pollution levels worsening, the Centre’s air quality panel on Saturday directed authorities to impose a ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR, except in essential projects, and other curbs under stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan.

Rai on Sunday said the Delhi government has set up 586 teams to ensure strict implementation of the ban on construction and demolition activities in the capital in view of worsening air quality.

GRAP is a set of anti-air pollution measures followed in the capital and its vicinity according to the severity of the situation.

It classifies the air quality in the Delhi-NCR under four different stages: Stage I – ‘Poor’ (AQI 201-300); Stage II – ‘Very Poor’ (AQI 301-400); Stage III – ‘Severe’ (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV – ‘Severe Plus’ (AQI >450).

Under stage III, the authorities have been asked to enforce a strict ban on construction and demolition activities in the NCR, except for essential projects and non-polluting activities such as plumbing, carpentry, interior decoration and electrical works.

The construction ban will not be applicable to projects concerning national security, defence, railways and metro rail among others. However, it is likely to affect housing projects in Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and other areas. Mining activities will not be allowed in the region.

The next stage in the “Severe Plus” category or Stage IV can include steps like a ban on the entry of trucks into Delhi, allowing 50 per cent of staff to work from home in public, municipal and private offices, closure of educational institutions and the plying of vehicles on an odd-even basis, etc.",['Press Trust Of India'],2022-10-30 12:38:32+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Pollution.jpg,[],[],,[],[]
This village in Jalandhar is 100% stubble burning free & setting an example for all of Punjab,"Jalandhar: Eleven kilometres from Jalandhar lies the village of Bajra, where the air is relatively cleaner than in nearby villages. Bajra boasts of being 100 per cent free of stubble burning for over five years now. At a time when farm fires a cause of concern for most of northern India, this hamlet in Punjab is a welcome aberration.

In the limited time they have between two crops, farmers here prefer alternative methods to clear their fields despite these techniques being high-priced and time-consuming.

This year too, the village did not witness any stubble burning incidents, according to officials of the state agriculture department. “Yes, we can confirm that Bajra has successfully managed its stubble and no fires were reported,” says an agriculture department official in Jalandhar who did not wish to be named.

Asked why other villages have not been able to follow suit, the official tells ThePrint: “We try our best. We spread awareness, but a lot of times farmers don’t listen to us. In fact, in some cases, we are held hostage by farmers when we go on field (visits).”

This movement in Bajra is driven by its farmers, sarpanches (past and present) and residents like Dr P.L. Bakhshi. Their insistence and to some extent, the fear of local authorities, is what convinced farmers here to give up stubble burning.

Spread over 100 acres and home to a population of roughly 1,100, Bajra is largely dependent on agriculture with paddy, wheat, potato and maize crops being primary sources of income. In a normal season, the village usually sees an output of 30-32 quintal of paddy per acre during the harvest. Moreover, farming activity is not restricted to the village and some farmers rent land on the outskirts of Bajra for the purpose of growing crops.

Both small and large farmers use machinery like super seeder and baler machines to manage stubble the best they can.

“We use all our force to not let anyone use fire to burn stubble. Whatever we are able to provide, be it tractor or machinery, we provide it to farmers,” says Bajra’s sarpanch Avinash Kumar. He adds that no time is wasted in informing the police and agriculture department in case someone tries to burn stubble.

“We have built most of what villagers need, such as roads or a cremation ground, therefore, people are also ready to listen to me. Farmers have to work more, spend more money but this (stubble management) has to be done,” he tells ThePrint.

‘Gives better yield, reduces use of fertilisers’

Maninder Singh, a farmer from Bajra claims he hasn’t burnt stubble since 2013. “We push our stubble back into the soil. Last time, after using super seeder, we got two quintals of extra wheat,” he says.

Singh adds that farmers like him who can afford expensive machinery rent it out to smaller farmers at low rates “because the work has to be done”.

“It (stubble management) not only reduces pollution in the air, but is more beneficial for the wheat or potatoes we grow. Ploughing the stubble back into the soil results in better yield at the end of the season. Even use of fertiliser is less, thus saving money,” says local farmer Sukhwant Singh, who is still in the process of removing stubble from his fields.

Farmers use a super seeder to plough stubble back into the soil. The machine, tied to a tractor, simultaneously sows seeds and sprays fertiliser across the field. Since the cost of the whole setup runs in lakhs, smaller farmers rent the super seeder every season, while larger landowners buy it and rent it out when not in use.

Another popular method of managing stubble is through baling – making stacks or ‘bales’ out of stubble using a baler machine. The bales are in turn used as fodder by cattle rearers who bear the cost of labour and diesel. However, Kumar explains that baling “results in additional cost of up to Rs 3,000 per acre” for the farmer.

‘Punitive measures not the way ahead’

A driving force behind this movement in Bajra are people like Dr P.S. Bakhshi, now a member of the Doctors for Clean Air and Climate Action initiative. “I have taken no steps and have put in no efforts. It is my village. I just stop my car when I am passing by and explain to them (farmers who burn stubble) that it is very harmful,” he tells ThePrint, adding that it took time for farmers to understand the advantages of alternative methods.

Bakhshi says he uses “simple talk” to build a rapport with local farmers. “We have to build a rapport with the farmer. For that, we call him chacha, taaya or fufa (uncle) and explain to him the hazards of stubble burning.”

Another reason why farmers listen to him is that Bakhshi is their go-to doctor. “They also think that, if we don’t listen to him, the doctor won’t do our work. There are others who think that the doctor will come again after us, so better not to do it all,” he explains.

Bakhshi is of the opinion that punitive measures may not be the way ahead to curb stubble burning. “If you try to be aggressive with farmers, they will not listen to you. But if you explain the same thing, with ease in Punjabi, then the farmer listens to you,” he says, while taking pride in the fact that Bajra is becoming a model for neighbouring villages.

Farmers in Haryana adopting alternative means of managing farm residue to prevent stubble burning,"Rohtak (Haryana) [India], November 5 (ANI): Incidents of stubble burning have come down in Haryana as farmers are adopting alternative means of managing agricultural residue.

The issue of stubble burning becomes a hot topic of discussion, especially at the onset of winter with the deteriorating air quality in Delhi NCR every year.



Farmers in Haryana's Rohtak opt for converting stubble into fodder, reducing the number of stubble-burning incidents in the state.



""We will not burn stubble now. It led to pollution. The government is buying our stubble at Rs 5,000 per acre. We can now buy fertilizers and seeds with the money,"" a local farmer told ANI.



Deputy Commissioner of Rohtak Yadav Yashpal said that stubble burning in Haryana has been reduced significantly in the past 3-4 years due to the efforts made by the state government.



""Haryana government's efforts in the last 3-4 years of providing alternate uses to farmers have led to the reduction in stubble burning cases by 23-24 per cent. Environmental Compensation charge will be imposed on anyone engaging in any fire incident. It is standard practice,"" said Yadav Yashpal.





Incidents of stubble burning have come down also in Ambala due to subsidy on super seeder by the state government.



A farmer said, ""We are getting Rs 1000 per acre. The stubble works as manure in the field, which increases the yield. The subsidy has been given on super seeder.""

The air quality in Delhi continued to remain in the 'severe' category on Saturday, for the third day in a row, even though a slight improvement was noted in the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the national capital, which stood at 431 this morning.



Also, areas in the national capital region (NCR) area - Noida and Gurugram at 7 am this morning recorded an AQI of 529 and 478 respectively both in the highly toxic 'severe'. Dhirpur in West Delhi recorded an AQI of 534.

On Friday, SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) said that stubble-burning accounted for 34 per cent of Delhi's particulate matter (PM) 2.5 pollution.

AQI from 0 to 100 is considered as good, while from 100 to 200 it is moderate, from 200 to 300 it is poor, and from 300 to 400 it is said to be very poor and from 400 to 500 or above it is considered as severe.

People of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) complained of choking and 'eye burning' due to smog and air pollution leaving people gasping for breath.



Speaking to ANI, Dr Suresh Kumar, Medical Director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, Delhi said, ""Number of patients suffering from Asthma, respiratory problems and blood pressure has increased. Polluted air with increased PM 2.5 presence exacerbates breathing problems in affected people. 10-15 people and 2-3 children coming every day to the hospital.""

Why farmers in Punjab struggle to discard their crop residue,"Even as Delhi’s air quality deteriorated sharply over the last few days, it has emerged that stubble burning in Punjab have increased by 2 per cent over the September 15-October 5 2022 period, compared to the same period last year. Punjab accounted for 82 per cent of 35,699 cases recorded by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) this year.

Stubble burning incidents in Haryana, which witnessed a sharp rise last year, have declined 37 per cent over the same period this year, with the State witnessing 2,530 cases of farm fires, accounting for 7 per cent of the cases. Madhya Pradesh, with 2,246 cases this year, recorded a jump of 8 per cent over the year-ago period.

Why Haryana fares better

One reason why farmers in Haryana seem to be better at managing their stubble compared to their counterparts in Punjab is that some have found buyers for their residue. “We are earning a profit of ₹1,000/acre after some buyers showed interest in the paddy residues. Earlier there was no takers and farmers did not want to spend an extra ₹4,000/5,000 per acre (for disposal),” Ashok Dahiya, a farmer in Haryana’s Sonipat district, said.

He said he sold his stubble for ₹6,000-8,000/acre which helped him to recover the hiring charges of labour and also left him some profit. In Palwal (Haryana), farmers like Yudhistir Sharma are earning even more -- up to ₹3,000/acre -- from their stubble.

“There is a big demand for stubble for cattle feed and buyers are coming from Mewat region, which is famous for livestock rearing, and paying ₹8,000-9,000/acre depending on the quality of crop residues,” Sharma said, adding that they save ₹2,000-3,000/acre after paying labour charges.

Farmers from Punjab have not had such luck. Many are actually waiting for someone to pick up the stubble from their fields free of cost. “We hear and read about companies procuring paddy residues, but none has come to our village. Nor are decomposers available,” said Amrik Singh, a farmer in Ludhiana district.

Addressing two problems

The air quality during winter will continue to suffer year after year until Punjab government shows a desire to solve it, said Vijay Sardana, a food policy analyst. Suggesting court intervention in the matter, Sardana said there is a need to change the design of harvesters and to allow Food Corporation of India (FCI) to procure alternative crops in place of paddy from Punjab.

He also demanded that free power for paddy should be stopped. “This will address two problems -- air pollution of Delhi and North India and the water table of Punjab. Unfortunately, Punjab has no action plan except demanding more taxpayers’ money from the Union government,” Sardana added.

It is a larger issue and there is no simple solution, believes IARI director AK Singh. “Apart from in-situ management, using happy seeder and similar equipment, using residue as raw material for power generation and using PUSA decomposer, there can be some policy intervention required,” he said.

This year, the early sowing of wheat in some States has also led to an increase in farm fires incidents compared to last year, said a scientist involved in monitoring the incidents. A clear picture will emerge after the end of this month whether there will be reduction in such incidents or not, he added.

Latest official data show wheat has been planted in nearly 5 lakh hectares in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan against none until November 3 last year, whereas in UP sowing areas have doubled. In Punjab and Haryana wheat is yet to be sown.

“If 130 days duration paddy varieties (already available) are sown, it will give enough time to farmers to sow wheat after harvesting the paddy crop,” AK Singh said. “Farmers need a gap of at least 10-15 days between the paddy harvest and planting of wheat, and it is a challenge for scientists to develop shorter duration varieties of paddy and wheat without compromising on yield,” he said.

Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s statement owning responsibility and asking for time to curb the problem, seems to be public posturing since he made it clear that “farmers are not responsible for it and they will stop burning ‘parali’ the day they have a solution.”

Collective responsibility

The comparative data on stubble burning varies by the day, and a clear picture will only emerge at the end of the season. For instance, the increase in stubble-burning cases in Punjab was 13 per cent up to November 4 this year, and it came down to 2 per cent up to November 5. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh, until November 4 last year there was 73 per cent rise in cases whereas at the end of the season there was 42 per cent fall.

At a workshop on November 4 in Delhi for better and optimum utilisation of PUSA decomposer by farmers, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that proper management of paddy stubble is the collective responsibility of all to prevent pollution. He said a comprehensive solution to this problem is possible with the optimum utilisation of 2.07 lakh machines made available to the States for stubble management with the assistance provided by the Centre.",[],2022-11-06 10:38:54+00:00,https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ujmdkn/article66103771.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/PTI10_30_2022_000070B.jpg,[],[],,[],[]
Stubble burning back to haunt Delhi-NCR- The New Indian Express,"Vatsala Shrangi By

Express News Service

NEW DELHI: Instances of paddy stubble burning have started appearing in parts of Pakistan, and the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, satellite imagery data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) showed. Fumes from the farm fires travelling to Delhi-NCR trigger an annual air pollution crisis every winter.

Scientists and weather officials studying the crop stubble burning pattern warned that this year since monsoon withdrawal has been delayed on account of late September rain in the whole of northwest India, the farm fires may peak around mid-October and coincide with Diwali, which will be celebrated on October 24 this year.

Each year, despite a ban, bursting of firecrackers on Diwali as well as the fumes from stubble burning result in a toxic combination, leading to a massive spike in air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR.

“Crop fires have started appearing in satellite observations over part of Pakistan while the region is still very cloudy,” said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research, Universities Space Research Association.

NASA’s fire map showed red dots indicating farm fires appearing in the northwest region, including parts of Pakistan, Punjab and Haryana. Most of the dots could be seen over Punjab, including those in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Jalandhar, among others.

The IMD in its Wednesday bulletin said that monsoon is likely to further withdraw from parts of northwest and Central India over the next two to three days. “The line of withdrawal of the southwest monsoon passes through Khajuwala, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Naliya. Conditions are becoming favourable for further withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some more parts of northwest India and some parts of adjoining central India during next 2-3 days,” the bulletin stated.

This monsoon, Delhi-NCR and northwest, including Punjab and Haryana received intense and continuous rain spells during September leaving the soil wet and a large amount of moisture in the atmosphere.

“The incidents of paddy stubble burning are likely to pick up from October first week when the monsoon finally withdraws and farmers are in a hurry to harvest the paddy crop in order to ready the fields to sow the rabi,” said a senior IMD official.

Centre accuses Punjab of not taking adequate steps to prevent stubble burning,"New Delhi: The Centre on Wednesday said incidents of stubble burning have started increasing rapidly, especially in Punjab, and the state government has not taken adequate steps to prevent farm fires. At an inter-ministerial meeting on the issue of crop residue burning in Delhi-NCR, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav expressed concern that the Punjab government has not been able to take coordinated actions to contain farm fires in the state. Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar mentioned that the status of paddy straw management in Haryana is ""significantly better than that in Punjab"", the environment ministry said in a statement.

""Till October 15, the trend of fire events was less as compared to last year but now it has started growing rapidly, especially in Punjab,"" the statement read.

The ministers noted that the Pusa bio-decomposer - a microbial solution which turns stubble into manure in 15-20 days - was being sprayed in a lesser area in Punjab and its application needs to be promoted and enhanced.

M M Kutty, the chairman of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), said Punjab has taken ""inadequate"" steps in spite of several meetings and efforts by the statutory panel.

The Punjab chief secretary was asked to control the increasing rate of fire events in Amritsar and to ensure a 50 percent reduction in cases of farm fires in the state in comparison to last year.

It was mentioned in the meeting that one of the main concerns is the delayed delivery of crop residue management machines in Punjab and Haryana.

Along with unfavourable meteorological conditions, paddy straw burning in adjoining states is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November. Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and vegetables.

A look at data on Punjab farm fires

Government data shows Punjab and Haryana generate around 27 million tonnes of paddy straw a year, of which around 6.4 million tonnes is not managed. According to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Punjab reported 71,304 farm fires between September 15 and November 30 last year and 83,002 farm fires in the corresponding period in 2020. Last year, the share of farm fires in Delhi's PM 2.5 pollution peaked at 48 percent on November 7.",['Zee Media Bureau'],None,https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2022/10/19/1105631-stubble-burning.jpg,[],[],,[],[]
Revenue official who went to inspect stubble burning held hostage by Faridkot farmers,"By ANI

FARIDKOT: A revenue official (Patwari) who was out to inspect stubble burning was held hostage by farmers for over 24 hours at the Jeewan Wala village of the Faridkot district in Punjab.

The farmers demanded a written assurance of no challan over the burning of their stubble and said that the official will not be set free until their demands are met.

The patwari had visited the district to inspect a report of stubble burning which is being reported across the state.

However, Kalnab Tehsildar and SDM Kotkapura reached the spot and tried to talk to the farmers, however, they failed to convince the farmers to let go of the official.

""SDM promised that machines will be provided but nothing has been done. We burn stubble as there is no other option,"" a farmer said.

Earlier on Thursday, local farmers in Punjab's Bathinda district expressed their dissatisfaction over Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann-led state government's failure to find an alternative to the stubble-burning problem and threatened to hold hostage any officials coming to stop them from burning the stubble.

""If any officials come to stop us from burning the residue on the farm, they will be held hostage, the government can impose as many fines on them but we will not pay the fine,"" the local villagers of Bhatinda said.

Lashing out at the government's poor uptake to obviate the problem of stubble burning, the local farmers said, ""They are compelled to set the stubble on fire every year. It is not their hobby to do all this. Farmers and their families get affected due to the stubble smoke first of all.""

Earlier today, Delhi CM Kejriwal took responsibility for the stubble burning in Punjab.

""Pollution is not just Delhi's but entire Northern India's problem. The Centre has to come forward and take specific steps so that entire North India can be relieved from pollution. Air pollution is a North India problem. AAP, the Delhi government or the Punjab government are not solely responsible. Now is not the time for the blame game. There should not be politics over such a sensitive issue. I admit there is stubble burning in Punjab,"" Kejriwal said.

Kejriwal hoped that lot lesser incidents of stubble burning would be reported in Punjab by next year and said that steps are being taken for it.

""Farmers are not responsible for it. They want a solution. The day they find the solution, they will stop burning stubble.

The Delhi chief minister's remarks come after the national capital reported the air quality in the 'severe' category for the second consecutive day.

FARIDKOT: A revenue official (Patwari) who was out to inspect stubble burning was held hostage by farmers for over 24 hours at the Jeewan Wala village of the Faridkot district in Punjab. The farmers demanded a written assurance of no challan over the burning of their stubble and said that the official will not be set free until their demands are met. The patwari had visited the district to inspect a report of stubble burning which is being reported across the state. However, Kalnab Tehsildar and SDM Kotkapura reached the spot and tried to talk to the farmers, however, they failed to convince the farmers to let go of the official.

Only ₹23 crore paid to farmers since 2018 for crop loss: NGO,"July 25, 2022 12:02 am | Updated 12:05 am IST - HYDERABAD

With heavy rains and floods ravaging several parts of the State, crop loss faced by farmers has become a point of discussion again. Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an NGO working on farmer’s issues, has faulted the government for not fulfilling lofty promises made to farmers about crop loss compensation due to natural calamities.

“In the past few years, the government of Telangana has not distributed any disaster compensation to farmers for crop loss despite the occurrence of heavy rains, floods, hailstorms or large scale pest and disease attack almost every year. The only exception was in 2018, when RSV filed a case in the High Court and the government was forced to distribute input subsidy, but that was only a meagre amount of ₹23 crore. For the unprecedented floods of 2020, no compensation was given despite High Court order in RSV case. Similarly, there was no compensation for heavy rains and floods in July and September 2021. For the hailstorm of January 2022, though Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy visited chilli and fruit farmers in Warangal and promised support, nothing was given. When there was extensive damage of chilli due to thrips pest attack during early 2022, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had promised disaster compensation in the Assembly but nothing has reached the farmers,” Vissa Kiran Kumar of RSV told The Hindu.

He added that the State government is not implementing the standard practice of farmer-wise enumeration of crop loss immediately after a disaster, so that even when the government receives disaster relief funds, it is not in a position to distribute to the farmers who suffered crop loss.

“Even in 2018, the enumeration was done only in a couple of districts like Adilabad and Khammam due to the initiative of the Collectors, and most of the crop compensation went to those districts. In the past two years, when RSV approached district collectors regarding enumeration, they said that there were no instructions from the Commissioner’s office, hence they have not initiated,” he said.

The RSV representative alleged that even though ₹188.23 crore was approved by the Centre for crop loss during the October 2020 floods, no farmer received compensation.",[],2022-07-24 18:32:56+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/lv35gf/article65679454.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/MEMAU_20_7_2022_13_53_7_4_1006.JPG,[],[],,['Warangal'],"['Adilabad', 'Khammam']"
Delhi’s air ‘very poor’ on morning after Diwali but relatively better than previous years,"New Delhi: The air quality in Delhi on the morning after Diwali was recorded in the ‘very poor’ category but the situation was relatively better than previous years due to favourable meteorological conditions which diluted the effect of firecrackers and stubble burning.

The capital’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 326 at 8 am on Tuesday. The neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (285), Noida (320), Greater Noida (294), Gurugram (315) and Faridabad (310) reported ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ air quality.

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. The relatively better air this morning doesn’t mean it’s good air. The PM2.5 levels at 30 out of the 35 monitoring stations in the capital were five to six times the national standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre at 8 am.

PM2.5 are fine particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can travel deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and entering the bloodstream.

Though people burst firecrackers in several parts of Delhi despite a ban on them, the intensity appeared less as compared to the last two years.

The Delhi government had in September announced a complete ban on the production, sale and use of all types of firecrackers till January 1, 2023, including on Diwali, a practice it has been following for the last two years.

Farm fires raged across Punjab and Haryana on Monday but the wind speed was moderately unfavourable for the transport of smoke. Hence, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution (around 10 per cent) was also “not very significant”, said Gufran Beig, chair professor, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science.

Emissions from firecrackers and farm fires have contributed significantly to Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Diwali over the years.

Their share this year was relatively less than previous years due to reduced firecrackers bursting and moderately warm and windier conditions which prevented rapid accumulation of pollutants.

Diwali was celebrated on November 4 in 2021 and on November 14 in 2020 when temperatures were considerably low and winds calm.

According to the Early Warning System of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the air quality is predicted to remain in the ‘very poor’ category during the day (Tuesday) and is likely to improve slightly over the next two days.

Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 312 at 4 pm on Monday — the second best for Diwali day in seven years.

Before this, the city recorded an AQI of 281 on Diwali in 2018.

Delhi had recorded an AQI of 382 on Diwali last year, 414 in 2020, 337 in 2019, 319 in 2017, and 431 in 2016, according to Central Pollution Control Board data.

On Sunday evening, the city reported a 24-hour average AQI of 259, which was the lowest for Diwali eve in seven years.

“The share of PM2.5 in Delhi’s air has increased which is indicative of contribution from firecrackers and stubble burning,” said Beig, also the founder project director of SAFAR, a forecasting agency under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences.

“Though the active fire counts have doubled, the wind direction is north westerly and the wind speed is moderate (not very favourable for the transport of smoke from farm fires). Hence, the contribution of stubble burning is not very significant,” he said.

Stubble burning is likely to account for 12 to 15 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 solution on Tuesday, he added.

The Indian Agricultural Research Institute reported 1,019 farm fires in Punjab, 250 in Haryana and 215 in Uttar Pradesh on Monday evening.

The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had earlier predicted that the air quality in Delhi will be recorded in the ‘very poor’ category if no firecrackers are burst.

In case firecrackers are burst like last year, the air quality may plunge to ‘severe’ levels on the night of Diwali itself, it had said.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai had earlier said bursting of firecrackers on Diwali in the city will attract a jail term up to six months and a fine of Rs 200.

He had said production, storage and sale of firecrackers here will be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 5,000 and three years in jail under Section 9B of the Explosives Act.

A total of 408 teams have been constituted to implement the ban. The Delhi Police has set up 210 teams under assistant commissioners of police, the Department of Revenue has set up 165 teams and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee has constituted 33 teams.

'Stubble burning cases in Haryana not even 10% in comparison to Punjab': Manohar Lal Khattar,"Chandigarh: Haryana Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday claimed that the cases of stubble burning in Haryana are not even 10 per cent of that in Punjab. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh on Monday, Khattar said, ""There are not even 10 per cent cases of stubble burning in Haryana as compared to Punjab. Last year there were 2,561 incidents of stubble burning, whereas it has decreased to 1,925 this year while 13,873 incidents have taken place in Punjab this year."" He said that Haryana has also appealed to Punjab regarding stubble burning and the pollution it causes. ""NGT has given directions to Punjab. We have also appealed (to them) that the pollution will not remain in one state but will spread to many states,"" he further added.

Khattar said that Haryana created awareness among the farmers and took legal action when needed, it also imposed penalties and registered FIRs. This led to a decline in incidents of stubble burning in the state as compared to Punjab.

Notably, Stubble burning had turned worse across Punjab, giving no hope of improvement in Delhi`s Air Quality Index (AQI) as the capital gasps for clean air. Increasing incidents of stubble burning in Punjab this year have become a matter of serious concern with the Union Environment Ministry pointing out that the AQI is likely to sharply deteriorate as only about 45-50 per cent of sown area in the state had been harvested till October 24.

Sources in the Environment Ministry had told ANI that the contribution of stubble burning to the adverse air quality in Delhi and the National Capital Region has been increasing sharply and is about 18-20 per cent currently with the trend only likely to increase further. As per the Standard Protocol developed by ISRO for Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), for the period September 15, 2022, to October 26, 2022, total paddy residue burning events reported in Punjab were 7,036 compared to 6,463 for the same period during the last year.

CAQM further stated that about 70 per cent of farm fires during the current paddy harvesting season were reported only from six districts namely Amritsar, Firozpur, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Patiala, and Tarn Taran. These districts account for 4,899 cases against a total of 7,036 incidents in Punjab. These traditional six hotspot districts also accounted for about 65 per cent of the total burning incidents during the last year for the same period.

Highlights Paddy straw burning in Punjab is a major reason behind air pollution in Delhi during winter

AAP governments in Punjab, Delhi have come together to combat stubble burning

Punjab govt has also proposed to give Rs 2,500 per acre to paddy growers

Paddy straw burning in Punjab is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November. Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. Will the days of eye-stinging, coughing, and nausea that Delhi residents have endured throughout each transition from autumn to winter over the past few years may finally come to an end? Delhi and Punjab are both ruled by Aam Aadmi Party and peopel are hoping this time both the state governments together put an end to Delhi's killer air pollution.

Can this winter be different?

AAP governments in Punjab and Delhi have come together to combat stubble burning, for which they will soon be launching a pilot project to manage crop residue.

What's the new project all about, can it really solve the issue?

Under the new project, a bio decomposer will be sprayed on 5,000 acres in Punjab. A Pusa bio decomposer will be sprayed on stubble following which the crop residue gets mixed in the soil. The Punjab government has made adequate preparations to prevent pollution caused by paddy stubble. Equipment are being provided to farmers on subsidy, awareness and surveillance teams have been formed in all districts.

Awareness and cash incentives for farmers

The Punjab government has proposed to give Rs 2,500 per acre to paddy growers. A massive awareness drive has been launched in the rural belt of Punjab to persuade farmers to manage the stubble.

Punjab generates around 20 million tons of paddy straw annually. In 2020, scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute had come up with a Pusa bio decomposer, a microbial solution, which can decompose stubble and turn into manure in 15-20 days. The Delhi government had provided it free to farmers in the capital to manage stubble in non-basmati rice fields in 2020 and 2021.

Farmers Must Learn More Effective Ways to Get Rid of Stubble,"The environmentalist and CEO of Grow-Trees.com says burning stubble has long-lasting effects and affects soil fertility significantly

Many newspaper reports have reported how the pollution in Delhi-NCR, post-Diwali assumed dangerous toxicity levels. The reasons behind the eighth consecutive year of toxic air quality range from stubble burning and vehicular pollution to vehement cracker burning.

Bikrant Tiwari, environmentalist and CEO of social organisation Growtrees says, ""What I found most alarming about this report based on a survey (carried out by LocalCircles), was that 70% of people have at least one or more family members who have been impacted by poor air quality. Those suffering could include babies, the elderly and even people with pre-existing medical conditions. Many people are forced to travel out of the city during this time but that is not a sustainable solution to this problem. What about those who cannot afford to travel?""



In winter the heedless bursting of crackers along with stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh which refers to a simplistic method of removing residual paddy crop to make way for fresh rabi crop sowing, does not help matters.



Bikrant under whose leadership GrowTrees has helmed afforestation initiatives and supported indigenous farming projects across the country says the practice of rubble burning is counter-productive at many levels and not only alters the air quality significantly but also affects soil fertility. He adds, ""This practice eventually destroys the soil nutrients and also kills the bacterial and fungal populations that are necessary for soil fertility. Burning also causes a large number of airborne microorganisms to die, which increases pest populations and, in turn, increases crop diseases. Stubble burning also leads to fire accidents and significant property damage.""

So how can we resolve this issue?

Bikrant suggests, "" To prevent the carbon stored in grass or biomass from being released into the atmosphere, stubble can be used in a more productive manner by putting it back into the earth i.e. using it for composting purposes. It can also be converted into fodder or organic fertilizer or fuel. Farmers need to be made aware of how burning stubble has long-lasting effects and that there are more effective ways to get rid of stubble before planting the next crop. Burning stubble results in a significant loss of organic carbon, nitrogen, potassium, and sulphur every year. Ideally, it should be utilised to create organic manure. As a result, there will be less need for chemical fertilisers.""

Bikrant says that we also need to take into account, the fact that farmers frequently have no other options besides burning stubble and typically, lack the necessary equipment to reduce stubble induced fires. He concludes, ""Our project ‘Trees for Farmers’ in Madhya Pradesh involves plantation of timber, fruit, and vegetable species to promote other forms of livelihood. Similarly, we need to create awareness among farmers about the other crops they can plant that can supplement their income so that they don’t have to resort to stubble burning to plant wheat.""",[],2022-11-05 16:57:24+05:30,https://english.sakshi.com/sites/default/files/article_images/2022/11/5/fields-1667647644.jpg,[],[],,['Warangal'],"['Adilabad', 'Khammam']"
UP govt mulling stringent legal action as stubble burning cases spike,"Lucknow, Nov 6 (PTI) With measures like seizing unauthorised farm equipment to imposing fines failing to check incidents of stubble burning, the Uttar Pradesh government is mulling over taking stringent legal penal actions, including lodging FIRs against the offenders.

Though awareness campaigns regarding those highlighting the harms of stubble burning were held, they did not show better results.

According to the data of Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), which is also used by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), close to 800 different fire farm incidents were reported in the last fortnight from 18 districts.

These comprise Aligarh, Barabanki, Fatehpur, Kanpur Nagar, Mathura, Hardoi, Sambhal, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut, Saharanpur, Rampur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Bulandshahr, Shamli and Bareilly districts.

While the government is urging farmers to adopt alternative means to dispose of stubble, the growers claim that the suggested measures are “impractical”.

Gurupal Singh, a farmer of Powayan in Shahjahanpur, said, “The easiest way for us to dispose of stubble is to burn them. Other measures like uprooting them with special equipment, spraying biochemicals etc are labour intensive that cost money.

“This also needs to be done quickly to prepare the field for the next crop. In such a case, poor farmers like me are left with no option but to burn the stubble,” he said.

Singh said he was penalised for stubble burning in 2019.

Apart from holding awareness campaigns, the district administration is also slapping such farmers with fines.

In Rampur, the district administration has imposed a fine of Rs 55,000 on different farmers across the district for stubble burning in a week.

According to district officials, Rs 32,500 of this have been collected as fine so far.

Similarly, in Fatehpur district, the administration has collected Rs 27,000 as fine from farmers involved in stubble burning.

The Fatehpur district administration has also seized 16 harvesters operating without the necessary equipment to reduce stubble waste.

According to the directives of the state government, for anyone caught burning agricultural residue or waste in fields in Uttar Pradesh, the fine is Rs 2,500 for fields less than two acres, Rs 5,000 for two-five acres and Rs 15,000 for fields above five acres.

Assistant Divisional Magistrate (Finance) of Bulandshahr, Vivek Kumar Mishra said, “Apart from fines, the farmers can face up to six months of imprisonment on repeat offences. We have intimated this to farmers in awareness camps held in the district. The village heads have been asked to remain vigilant and report any incident of stubble burning.” Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh is one of the districts with the worst air quality in the state.

The district administration has organised more than two dozen awareness camps to educate farmers about harms of stubble burning. Teams have also been formed at tehsil level to present such incidents, said the officer.

The district administration has roped in village heads to prevent stubble burning.

District Magistrate of Sultanpur Raveesh Gupta said, “The village heads have been asked to lodge an FIR against anyone involved in stubble burning. The village heads have been asked to take a picture of the incident which is mandatory to lodge FIR.” Two farmers were fined Rs 2,500 each for stubble burning in the district on October 31. Similar action will be taken against anyone found burning stubble, he warned.

The recent action which indicates more stringent steps are on the anvil is in line with a government order issued to all divisional commissioners, district magistrates, and district police chiefs last month by the office of Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Durga Shankar Mishra.

The top bureaucrat in his letter asked the officials to ensure legal penal action against farmers found burning crop residues, and also create awareness among them about the negative impact farm fires can have on the environment.

According to government sources, these legal penal actions also include lodging FIRs against repeat offenders of stubble burning.

The burning of crop residues and garbage is seen as a major cause of air pollution during winter. The air quality worsens every year in the October-November period when paddy harvesting is done.

These fire incidents are expected to spike in the coming days, agriculture scientists claim.

“The paddy cultivation in Uttar Pradesh was delayed by an average of 35 days this year because of poor and delayed monsoon. Because of this, the paddy harvest is expected to continue till the last week of November,” said Senior Scientist of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) Shubham Singh.

The delay in harvest can be a troubling sign for the air quality if stubble-burning incidents continue, he said.

“The temperatures will drop further by the end of November as winter sets in. If stubble burning is done in such weather conditions, it will take smoke longer to settle down, keeping the air polluted for a longer period of time,” explained Singh. PTI CDN SNS CK RHL

"Don’t politicise stubble burning, need collective measures: Tomar","November 05, 2022 05:02 am | Updated 05:02 am IST - New Delhi

Distancing from the political war of words over stubble burning, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has urged for collective steps to solve the problem.

Addressing farmers who used Pusa decomposer developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) for efficient management of paddy stubble, Mr. Tomar said the States and the Centre should work together for a scientific solution to the problem. Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav and the BJP had blamed the AAP Government in Punjab for the air pollution in Delhi.

Mr. Tomar said a discussion on managing the paddy straw is more important than a political discussion. “The problem of stubble burning is serious and levelling allegations and counter allegations on this issue are not justified. Be it the Central or State governments or farmers, everyone has the same objective that agriculture should flourish in the country and there is prosperity for farmers,” the Minister said.

He added that burning of stubble causes harm to the environment and to people and therefore a way should be found to deal with it and follow that path. The decomposer developed by the IARI, he said, not only ensures that the soil will be safe, but also pollution will be reduced.

The Union Agriculture Ministry said in a release that the Pusa decomposer has been used in 26 lakh acres in Uttar Pradesh, five lakh acres in Punjab, 3.5 lakh acres in Haryana and 10,000 acres in Delhi and its use has yielded very good results.

Mr. Tomar said the Centre has provided more than ₹3000 crore to Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi governments for stubble management.

“A comprehensive solution to this problem is possible with optimum utilisation of 2.07 lakh machines made available to the States for stubble management with the assistance provided by the Centre. Also, using the Pusa decomposer developed by the Pusa Institute will increase the fertility of cultivable land along with solving the problem,” he said.",[],2022-11-04 23:32:00+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/sr8p70/article66097994.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_bl07_comm_Tomar_2_1_UP8V155T.jpg,[],[],,['Warangal'],"['Adilabad', 'Khammam']"

He said that Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann had meetings with farmers over the issue.

""We are constantly trying that the stubble should not be burnt at least in Punjab. All the officials have been told that there will be no FIR against the farmers. But we believe that the farmers will avoid stubble burning. We are also working in the direction to ensure stubble becomes an additional source of income for the farmers in the coming days,"" added Dhaliwal.

Last week, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said that the state government is committed to bailing out the farmers of the state from any sort of natural calamity and efforts are being made for paddy straw management.

The Chief Minister, during a meeting with the farmers here at Punjab Bhawan, said that the state government is not leaving any stone unturned for this cause. He also informed the farmers that the state government is making an all-out effort for paddy straw management.

""The farmers should support the state government for this noble cause by not burning the paddy straw. It is the need of the hour for protecting the environment of the state,"" said CM Mann.

Last month, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar called upon the state governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi to strive for achieving zero stubble burning in the very near future. He promised all central help to achieve this mission.

Singh had announced that those who found burning stubble in the district “may be deprived of government facilities and will also face legal action.” He also added that the firearms license of the violators shall be cancelled with immediate effect. He said that Nambardar, Panch and Sarpanch of each village will be held responsible for fire incidents. If a Nambardar himself sets fire to his field, his nambardar post will also be gone, said the deputy commissioner. Similarly, legal action will also be recommended against Panch and Sarpanch to the department, he said.

Singh stated that the district administration was considering suspending crop compensation payments to farmers who would break the decree. He stated that the Moga district has an adequate supply of machinery for stubble control. This machinery's information is being uploaded to the I-Khet app. Farmers should make the most of this equipment. The district administration will shortly release helpline numbers to assist farmers.

Stubble burning is the deliberate burning of straw stubble that remains after grains such as rice and wheat have been harvested. Despite its harsh effects on air pollution, this method is still widely used today because of its convenient and cheap approach.

Some Punjab farmers have defied the restriction on stubble burning. They claim that they will continue to burn paddy stubble until they are adequately reimbursed for the costs of alternative agricultural residue disposal methods. The Punjab’s AAP government backed down after declaring it would offer 2,500 per acre to paddy growers; wherein the Centre was to split 1,500 per acre, while the Punjab and Delhi governments were to share 1,000 per acre.

According to data from the government-run monitoring agency, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the average contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM 2.5 level in November 2021 was 14.6%. This could be greatly reduced if severe procedures are implemented. Furthermore, more CBG plants must be promoted. Farmers must be given confidence in all initiatives that are implemented. Aside from this, crop rotation could be a long-term solution.",['Zee Media Bureau'],None,https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2022/10/13/1101999-untitled-42.png,[],[],,['Warangal'],"['Adilabad', 'Khammam']"
AAP dole to prevent stubble burning,"By Express News Service

NEW DELHI: Months leading to the winter are known for the farm fires in neighbouring states – a major cause of air pollution in the national capital. This time around, the Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in both Delhi and Punjab, plans to offer cash incentives to farmers to refrain from burning stubble. The party has also requested the Centre to share the cost for the same, officials said.

“We have prepared a proposal to provide a cash incentive to farmers who desist from burning paddy straw. The plan is that the Centre should bear 50% of the cost and Punjab and Delhi will contribute 25% each,” said a senior Punjab government official.

The official said that Delhi will share the cost since smoke from farm fires impact air quality in the national capital. “The proposal has been sent to the Centre. Once it is approved, it will be tabled before the Punjab cabinet,” the official said.

However, the official went on to say that the Punjab and Delhi governments are ready to implement the scheme even if the Centre doesn’t agree. The period from early October to November in Delhi sees major smog episodes on account of paddy straw (stubble) burning in Punjab and Haryana, the fumes thus produced adding to the pollutants over Delhi and the NCR.

This is the time when farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the paddy stubble to ready their farms for sowing rabi (wheat) crops, as there is a brief window between the harvest of kharif (paddy – various varieties of rice) and for preparing the farms to sow the next crop. Punjab, with a much larger region under cultivation, generates around 20 million tons of paddy straw annually.

Under a Centre-sponsored scheme, farm machinery is provided to farmers at a subsidised rate for in-situ management of the stubble. But, not all farmers are able to procure the machinery for various reasons including its cost and despite the Centre’s initiative, farm fires have continued contributing largely to bad air episodes in the capital.

“Farmers say a cash incentive can help them cover the cost of fuel used in operating the machinery,” said a Delhi government official. However, this will not be the first time that Punjab will give cash incentives to farmers for not burning stubble. The state governments of Punjab and Haryana had announced a bonus of `2,500 an acre for small and marginal farmers in 2019 too, following the Supreme Court’s suggestion to incentivise farmers to stop farm fires. But, a paucity of funds stalled the scheme. Punjab had even requested the Centre for financial assistance but to no avail.

As per Indian Agricultural Research Institute, last year Punjab had reported 71,304 farm fires between September 15 and November 30 while 83,002 farm fires in the corresponding period in 2020. Last year, the share of farm fires in the city’s PM 2.5 pollution had peaked to 48% on November 7.

"Just ahead of Delhi’s smog season, Punjab & Haryana farmers start setting fields on fire","Just days ahead of the national capital getting shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, farmers of Punjab and Haryana, aptly called India’s prominent granaries, have started setting their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue of paddy so that the field is ready for the next crop, mainly wheat.

Both states have two growing seasons: one from May to September and another from November to April. Many farmers rotate between crops, planting rice in May and wheat in November.

Punjab annually generates 20 million tonnes of paddy straw and this is normally set on fire to quickly clear the fields for the next crop, resulting in choking of the National Capital Region (NCR) in October and November.

As per the state agriculture department, the estimated waste generation from paddy harvesting in Haryana is around 3.5 million tonnes, with the crop mainly produced in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts.

Punjab recorded 71,304 paddy fire incidents in 2021, 76,590 in 2020, 55,210 in 2019 and 50,590 in 2018, with many districts including Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda and Amritsar, witnessing a large number of such incidents.

Comparatively much lower than Punjab, Haryana reported 6,987 fire incidents during the paddy harvest season in 2021 and 9,898 in 2020.

Sounding a warning note, a Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) official told IANS that the farm fire incidents is expected to reach its peak close to Diwali on October 24.

With numerous farm fires across Punjab and red outlines on satellite images showing the approximate locations of active burning, the Centre has warned the state government to chalk out a comprehensive action plan at the micro level for effective control of paddy stubble burning.

During the Assembly elections in Punjab this year, the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP party had promised to address the stubble burning issue. The national capital, also under the helm of the AAP government, gets shrouded in a thick blanket of smog particularly in October and November as the stubble fire picks up in the adjoining states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

Joining the blame game, Amit Malviya, in-charge of BJP’s National Information and Technology Department, said earlier Kejriwal would blame stubble burning in Punjab for pollution in Delhi.

“Now that the AAP is in power in Punjab, stubble burning has started again and it will choke Delhi and the rest of North India in no time,” Malviya tweeted. “What is Kejriwal doing to ensure that Delhi breathes clean?”

Last month, the AAP governments in Punjab and Delhi joined hands to combat stubble burning by spraying Pusa bio-decomposer on 5,000 acres in Punjab as a pilot project.

Agricultural experts say promoting crop diversification and shifting to a short duration paddy crop in Punjab can help reduce the stubble burning problem.

An estimated 39 million tonnes of paddy straw are being burnt every year in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.

However, PPCB Member Secretary Krunesh Garg does not see crop diversification as the long-term solution as it does not mean that biomass will not be produced by other crops.

“It will just be another kind of biomass waste, like cotton sticks and mustard straw waste coming from Rajasthan to Punjab. The issue with respect to the burning of this fuel will always remain. So we need to find solutions, both in situ and ex-situ. A combination of these can only be effective.”

Garg said it is not that the problem is not being addressed. “We are mapping it down to the block and village level, but it will take 4-5 years for proper problem resolution.”

Punjab Agriculture Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal told IANS the state is taking all possible steps to stop stubble burning in the paddy harvesting season that began on October 1.

To manage the stubble, the government is distributing 56,000 machines under in-situ management, taking the total tally of machines to 146,422.

Punjab saw 692 cases of stubble burning till October 7 with most of the incidents have been reported from the border belt of Majha region. Amritsar tops the chart with 25 stubble burning cases so far.

To minimise the farm fire incidents, the state government is making red-entries in the revenue records of farmers for indulging in the illegal practice.

Joining the issue, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), the state’s prominent farmers’ outfit, said the small landholding farmers are forced to burn the stubble out of compulsion.

At the meeting with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, BKU leaders asked him not to penalise farmers for setting ablaze the straw as they can’t afford to hire or buy heavy machinery for in-situ management of stubble.

Post-harvesting the wheat straw is used as fodder for the livestock, while paddy straw in the fields is set on fire by the farmers to quickly clear their fields for the next crop.

Due to field fire incidents from October to November, the problem of air pollution is widely prevalent in and around the rural area, causing major health effects.

Due to the climatic conditions, the air quality in NCR also deteriorates, with contribution from various local sources such as domestic, vehicular, industrial and municipal solid waste dump fires.

The latest in the series of measures taken by the Punjab government to tackle stubble burning include provision of crop residue management machines to the panchayats, cooperatives and individual farmers for in-situ crop residue management, use of paddy straw as energy resource for biomass based plants, monitoring and enforcement stubble burning, as well as awareness campaign in the farming community.

At a workshop organised in Chandigarh on October 3 by Delhi-based Climate Trends, Panjab University and PGIMER Chandigarh, representatives from pollution control boards, experts, practitioners and farmers came together to discuss the ground solutions.

Industry voices present at the session explained how there is no supply chain architecture for procuring the stubble waste from fields to provide to relevant industry.

They say there is a scope for entrepreneurs to build a startup economy by setting up logistics. There is a demand for aggregators.

Speaking on challenges of running an ex-situ utilisation industry, Ashish Kumar from German company Verbio India Pvt Ltd said: “Verbio does the biomass waste collection on our own because that kind of supply chain didn’t exist in India.

“Each stubble waste bail weighs 400-450 kg that can only be handled by mechanised systems only. This entire value chain of procurement, production and final supply of the gas for revenue generation is owned and operated by us, so imagine the complexity of this for a business owner.

“Our business model of converting biomass waste into fuel, which can be utilised by automotive or commercial purposes, can survive on three revenue streams — manure, gas, and carbon credits.

“Right now we can only generate revenue for gas, but the other two are not set up in India and till then these businesses will not be very viable.”

Paddy straw is also used as in waste-to-energy plants, brick kilns and end products.

Canada’s Saskatchewan-based company Clean Seed recently announced it had entered into a Letter of Intent with the Northern Farmers Producer Company Limited Mega Farmer Cooperative to market and distribute 1,000 smart seeder machines from 2023-2025 in both Punjab and Haryana.

With its multipurpose solutions such as managing straw and accurate seed and fertilizer placement in combination with the unique no-tillage practices, the smart seeder machines can bring a paradigm shift, Consul General of Canada in Chandigarh, Patrick Hebert, told IANS in a recent interview.",['Please Enter Your Name Here'],2022-10-09 21:00:00+05:30,https://hindupost.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Farmers_Stubble_Burning.jpg,[],[],,['Warangal'],"['Adilabad', 'Khammam']"
Telangana CM Promises Free Power to Farmers Across Nation If Non-BJP Govt. Comes to Power in 2024,"KCR said that we would provide free electricity to all farmers in the nation whenever a non-BJP government is formed.

President of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Chief Minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao while reiterating his plans to enter national politics announced free power to farmers across the nation if a non-BJP front is voted to power in the upcoming general election.

KCR also asked the people if he should enter national politics or not. On this, the crowd at Nizamabad shouted “Yes.”

The minister said, “Thanks for blessing me. I am making my first move in my journey in national politics with this meeting”.

KCR said let's make the country BJP-Mukt Bharat by pulling down the current government in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. We would provide free electricity to all farmers in the nation whenever a non-BJP government is formed.

The Modi government had listed airports, ports, banks, and public sector enterprises for sale, KCR noted. ""Right now, it is focusing on the agriculture sector. By weakening farmers and giving their control to large corporations, the Center is working to corporatize the agriculture sector.

""As part of this conspiracy, the Centre is insisting on installing electricity meters to the agriculture motors, along with increasing the prices of urea and fertilizers, to make agriculture an unprofitable endeavour for farmers,"" he said.

The chief minister also accused the BJP of fostering nationwide communalism by engaging in divisive politics. ""A house is difficult to build but simple to demolish it. States will prosper if the nation is peaceful and prosperous. It's time to remove this communal BJP from power, he claimed.

Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman NV Subhash ridiculed KCR’s national political ambition. He's only daydreaming of playing it big at the national level but as his recent journey to Bihar has shown, he is not taken seriously by any other regional party.

How can he hope to build a non-BJP government at the Centre and implement a free power supply scheme all across the nation with only nine MPs? he asked.

Subhash further said that KCR was talking of entering national politics only to make his son KT Rama Rao the chief minister.

SC to hear plea seeking measures to curb Delhi’s worsening air quality amid stubble burning,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear on November 10 a plea seeking measures to curb worsening air pollution in Delhi-NCR.

A bench of Chief Justice of India UU Lalit and Bela M Trivedi posted the case for hearing on November 10 after an advocate mentioned the matter for urgent hearing.

Advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha, who filed the plea, told the bench that stubble burning has increased in Punjab.

“Parali burning has increased in Punjab. Even normal people can’t walk in such a situation,” Jha argued.

The plea sought direction to summon Chief Secretaries of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and directed them to personally take responsibility for no case of stubble-burning anywhere.

It sought direction for issuing fresh guidelines to all the States with respect to stubble burning. The plea asked to issue guidelines to each and every State to take necessary measures in order to reduce pollution including the installation of smog towers, plantation drives, affordable public transport, etc.

“Public at large is forced to inhale polluted air and the oxygen filled with smog. Despite the clear orders of this Court to stop stubble burning and construction causing air pollution, there is rampant pollution in the National Capital Territory and other places making it difficult for people to survive,” said the plea adding that the situation is directly against the Right to life of people at large.

The petition said the AQI level on November 3 has been between 440 to 460 across Delhi which as per various sources “affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases”.

An AQI of 400 or higher is considered “severe,” and it can affect both healthy people and those who already have illnesses, it said.

It sought direction for appointing a high-level committee under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge to tackle the air-pollution crisis due to stubble burning.

The plea further urged that the schools, colleges, government and private offices to go virtual/online in order to protect the life of people at large.

The advocate said that the pollution is caused because states like Punjab have failed to provide an alternative to the farmers against stubble burning.to control pollution. (ANI)

PMFBY Latest Update: Telangana to Rejoin Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana This Kharif Season,"After the Center accepted the state government's proposal to make the PMFBY available to all farmers, the government of Andhra Pradesh stated earlier this month that it would rejoin the scheme, effective with the Kharif 2022.

Telangana is likely to rejoin Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana after withdrawing from it due to the ""highest cost of premium subsidy.""

According to sources, the Telangana government's demand for ""universal coverage"" of farmers under the scheme was accepted by the Centre.

Telangana is likely to implement PMFBY from Rabi 2023.

Six states—Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Gujarat left the scheme, claiming the high cost of premiums as the reason. As a result, their share of the premium subsidy was released later than expected. Insurance companies had trouble settling claims as a result of delayed insurance premiums.

After the Center accepted the state government's proposal to make the PMFBY available to all farmers, the government of Andhra Pradesh stated earlier this month that it would rejoin the scheme, effective with the Kharif 2022.

Telangana government took longer than expected to release its share of the premium under the PMFBY in 2018–19 and 2019–20, which caused the Center to stop the distribution of its share of the matching sum, delaying the settlement of the farmers' claims. After that, starting with the 2020 Kharif season, the Telangana government discontinued enforcing the PMFBY.

According to the updated PMFBY guidelines published as of Kharif 2020, the Centre had stipulated that in case of non-payment of the state’s share of the premium, subsidy within the prescribed timelines would lead to disqualification of the state government from implementing crop insurance from the next season.

The premium that farmers must pay under the substantially subsidized PMFBY is only 1.5% of the sum insured for rabi crops and 2 percent for Kharif crops, while it is 5% for cash crops. In the case of the northeastern states, the premium is divided between the Center and states in a ratio of 9:1, while the remaining premium is distributed equally between the Center and states.

Farmers' claims under the PMFBY have been declining in recent years. According to preliminary data, the ratio, which was 93.9% in the Kharif of 2018, has decreased to just 41.9% in the Kharif of 2021. The claim to premium ratio was 106.9% in rabi 2017, and it dropped to 47.1% in 2021.

In February 2020, the government made the PMFBY voluntary for farmers; previously, it was mandatory for farmers to take insurance cover under the scheme.

Presently, 21 states and union territories are using the scheme. Since its launch in 2016, the PMFBY has not been embraced by the Punjab government.

There are around 140 million farmer families in the country, according to estimates from the ministry of agriculture. In the past three years, enrolment under the PMFBY has not surpassed 20 million.

In an attempt to bring more people into the scheme, a working group formed by the ministry of agriculture and farmers' welfare to examine the PMFBY has recommended raising the claim-premium cap from the current 110% to 130%.

According to a working group analysis, the PMFBY premium has climbed by more than six times since 2016, which has increased the government's subsidy liability.",[],None,https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/75486/pmfby-2022-293485y.jpg,[],[],,"['Warangal', 'Bela']","['Adilabad', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad']"
"Air Pollution Big Problem For India, Needs Urgent Resolution: Nitin Gadkari","Nitin Gadkari said, ""We need to resolve pollution as it is a big problem."" (File)

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said air pollution is a big problem for the country, and there is an urgent need to reduce it.

The statement comes at a time when the air quality in Delhi has started to plummet to its worst level due to stubble burning in the neighbouring states of the national capital.

""For ecology and environment also we need to resolve pollution as it is a big problem,"" the road transport and highways minister said while addressing the International Conclave on Clean Fuels-2022.

Mr Gadkari also expressed concerns about the deteriorating air quality in Delhi and stressed converting the stubble into bio-vitamin.

The minister also said that in the country there are several successful projects, and Bio-CNG and Bio-LNG are being made from rice straw.

He also said there is an immediate need to decarbonise the transport sector and make it sustainable for the economy, ecology and environment.

""We are promoting the use of clean and green biofuel such as ethanol, methanol, bio-CNG, bio-LNG, bio-diesel, and green hydrogen and electricity also,"" he explained.

Clean fuel has multiple benefits as it leads to lower oil import bills, ensures energy security and decline in air pollution.

Bihar farmers to face FIR for burning stubble,"By Express News Service

PATNA: In a major initiative to curb the rising air pollution in Bihar, the state government has decided to file FIRs against farmers found guilty of burning stubble. The government has formed special teams in districts to check the practice.

The decision was taken after it was found that air quality in seven cities of the state has turned poisonous. Katihar has been adjudged the most polluted city, with an AQI of 393, and dust particles found to be six times the admissible limit.

For effective implementation of the decision, panchayats have been divided into two groups those with high incidents of stubble burning, and others with few or no cases. The government will also make tools related to crop residue management available to farmers. Street plays would be organised to create awareness.

Maximum incidents of stubble burning are reported from Patna and Magadh divisions, with Kaimur, Rohtas, Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna and Nalanda districts witnessing about 83% of such cases. “No lapses on the part of the officials will be tolerated,” Development Commissioner Vivek Kumar Singh said.

For effective implementation of the decision, panchayats have been divided into two groups those with high incidents of stubble burning, and others with few or no cases. The government will also make tools related to crop residue management available to farmers. Street plays would be organised to create awareness. Maximum incidents of stubble burning are reported from Patna and Magadh divisions, with Kaimur, Rohtas, Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna and Nalanda districts witnessing about 83% of such cases. “No lapses on the part of the officials will be tolerated,” Development Commissioner Vivek Kumar Singh said.",[],None,https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2022/11/4/w600X390/Stubble_burning_PTI.jpg,[],[],,"['Warangal', 'Bela']","['Adilabad', 'Khammam', 'Nizamabad']"
Telangana Agricultural Minister Urges Farmers To Grow Fruits As They Are In Demand,"The Agriculture Minister of Telangana Visited the Azadpur Market and observed the trading practices of its traders and farmers.

Minister of Agriculture, Co-operation and Marketing of Telangana Nirajan Reddy visited the largest fruit market of the nation which is the Azadpur market also known as the Azadpur Mandi. The minister visited the market as a part of his Delhi tour.

The Azadpur market is spread across 90 acres and was constructed in the year of 1975. The market currently generates total revenue of Rs. 100 crore per year.

The agri minister visited the market with the Director of Horticulture L Venkatram Reddy and Principal Secretary of Agriculture Raghunandan Rao. He closely observed the trading of fruits, vegetables, and turmeric in the market also and advised the farmers of the market to grow more fruits as it will help them to boost their incomes and will also meet the high demands of fruits in the market.

The Telangana Agriculture minister stated on Friday, that the state government is planning to construct a fruit market in the district of Rangareddy, Koheda village. The new fruit market will be spread across 178 acres.

The state government's motive behind this initiative is that they want to encourage farmers to grow more fruits, to meet the demand of the large population. The Telangana Warehouse Development Corporation has also established a cold storage unit to store large quantities of fruits.

While communicating with the market’s farmers, traders, and officials, Niranjan Reddy said that the demand for fruits has increased in the past few years and it will only continue to increase over the upcoming years.

Punjab Speaker announces ₹1 lakh to villages of his constituency to discourage stubble burning,"October 23, 2022 04:34 pm | Updated 04:34 pm IST - Chandigarh

To discourage stubble burning in his Assembly segment, Punjab Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan on Sunday announced that he will give ₹1 lakh to every village panchayat where farmers shun the practice.

This amount will be given from his discretionary quota, said an official statement in Chandigarh on Sunday.

Mr. Sandhwan, an AAP MLA, represents the Kotkapura Assembly constituency.

Mr. Sandhwan said the burning of paddy stubble has a harmful impact on the environment along with the loss of fertility of the land.

He said according the principles of the Gurbani, people of Punjab love nature the most.

""As people getting aware about the harmful effects of stubble burning, they are abandoning this trend,"" he said, according to the statement.

He said the day is not far when people of the state will completely abandon the practice.

Mr. Sandhwan had last week honoured people who did not burn paddy stubble, as per the statement.

""It was a unique initiative of its kind. In this ceremony, 18 farmers from Faridkot district, 13 from Moga, 10 from Sangrur, one from Rupnagar, 10 from Gurdaspur and seven from Ludhiana and Barnala were honoured,"" the statement said.

"Delhi Air Quality Shows Slight Improvement, Still At Upper End Of 'Very Poor' Category. Check AQI","According to the data released by SAFAR, AQI in the national capital stood at 339 on Sunday, a slight improvement over the AQI of 381 on Saturday. ( Image Source : Twitter/ANI )

New Delhi: The air quality in the National Capital Region was recorded in the “very poor” category on Sunday while Delhi’s AQI showed slight improvement as compared to Saturday. According to the data released by SAFAR, AQI in the national capital stood at 339 on Sunday, as compared to 381 on Saturday.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board. The improvement in air quality can be attributed to favourable wind speed and a dip in stubble burning. The AQI in Noida and Gurugram was also recorded in the “very poor” category. The AQI in Noida and Gurugram was 349 and 304 respectively.

""The wind direction will change frequently over the next few days due to back-to-back western disturbances. Hence, the net result will be very poor air quality,"" Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet Weather told PTI.

Air Quality Index from 0 to 100 is considered as good, while from 100 to 200 it is moderate, from 200 to 300 it is poor, and from 300 to 400 it is said to be very poor and from 400 to 500 or above it is considered as severe. The recurring problem of farm fires from the neighbouring states contributed 21 per cent to PM2.5 in Delhi, which was 34 per cent on Friday.

Noida Traffic Police Bans Entry Of Non-Essential Trucks, Cars To Delhi

Due to the rising air pollution levels in the national capital, the Noida Traffic Police on Saturday issued a traffic advisory announcing restrictions on the entry of non-essential trucks and other vehicles into Delhi from its borders.

According to the advisory issued by the Police Commissionerate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, the restrictions will be from Chilla Border, DND and Kalindi Kunj border.

However, a diverted route for going to their destinations will be provided. Under the Graded Action plan, entry of all trucks except those providing essential goods or services or those running on CNG or electric power are prohibited from entering Delhi from Noida.

The entry of BS-3 (petrol) and BS-4 (diesel) light four-wheeler vehicles in Delhi from the Noida border will also be banned.

""Entry for diesel-powered medium cargo vehicles and heavy goods vehicles except those engaged in essential goods and services is prohibited,"" the advisory further added.

According to the advisory, as an alternative route, all these vehicles can use the Yamuna Expressway or the Eastern Peripheral Expressway via Noida-Greater Noida Expressway to reach their destination.

Farmers In Haryana Adopt Alternative Means To Manage Farm Residue To Prevent Stubble Burning

Incidents of stubble burning have come down in Haryana as farmers are adopting alternative means of managing agricultural residue. Farmers in Haryana's Rohtak opt for converting stubble into fodder, reducing the number of stubble-burning incidents in the state. ""We will not burn stubble now. It led to pollution. The government is buying our stubble at Rs 5,000 per acre. We can now buy fertilizers and seeds with the money,"" a local farmer told ANI.

Curbs To Control Pollution Levels

The hazardous pollution levels prompted the Delhi government to announce on Friday that primary schools would remain shut from Saturday and 50 per cent of its staff will work from home, while private offices have been advised to follow suit.

A six-member panel chaired by the special commissioner of transport has been set up to monitor the implementation of curbs on anti-polluting activities. Revenue commissioners have been asked to prepare a plan for staggered timings of markets and offices.

CM Arvind Kejriwal had said the odd-even car rationing scheme would be implemented if the need arises and discussions on it were on.

"Amidst firecracker bans in several states, traders in Telangana expect roaring business as Diwali nears","Telangana is set to celebrate Diwali with the dazzling lights of diyas and stunning vistas of the fireworks, amidst other states prohibiting the usage of firecrackers ahead of the Hindu festival.

According to firecracker traders, limited production of green crackers and a 30-35 percent increase in cracker pricing over the previous year may have an impact on their business, as demand for green crackers is increasing.

Sivakasi, the hub of firecracker manufacturing units has slashed production after the Supreme Court banned the use of barium nitrate in firecrackers.

T Praveen Kumar of Cracker Mela told TOI that the school holidays in Telangana have been announced and sales are likely to go up from Saturday onwards. He also informed that last year they had a turnover of 70 crores but this year it may cross 100 crores.

Rocket shots, which were offered for Rs 80-130 a box last year, now cost Rs 170, according to traders. The price of sparklers and pencil crackers, which were sold for Rs 100 last year, has risen to Rs 130-140 per box. A small anar, which cost Rs 60 a box last year, is now worth Rs 100.

According to Manik Rao, owner of Bhavani Crackers,” as per Supreme Court rules, all licensed dealers have planned to offer green firecrackers this year.” They have prohibited the production of synthetic firecrackers due to their low emission. However, our biggest issue this time is that production of crackers was very low owing to terrible weather, and low availability of metals is also quite limited due to rising raw material prices. As a result of the Central Government directive, manufacturers have stopped importing metals from China.”

“There are no registered green manufacturing companies in Telangana,” said Telangana Fire Workers Dealers Association (TFWDA) president K Venugopal, “but we import the stock from Sivakasi fireworks industries in Tamil Nadu.” Last year’s market was mixed, but this year, apart from the unsold crackers, we’re only selling green fireworks.”

“We offer a variety of green crackers, and sales have surged because of the ongoing holidays this year after Covid.” Green crackers are priced 30-40% more than ordinary crackers,” he added.

Overall, despite facing several challenges Telangana is likely to witness a rise in firecracker sales this Diwali and give a much-needed boost to the fireworks industry.

Delhi

Meanwhile, Gopal Rai, Delhi’s Environment Minister, announced on October 19 that producing, storing, and selling firecrackers in the national capital is a serious offense. He went on to say that anyone caught engaging in these activities could face a Rs 5,000 fine and a six-month jail sentence.

Furthermore, anyone found purchasing and bursting firecrackers is also a punishable offence. Anyone caught engaging in these acts faces a Rs 200 fine and a six-month jail term.

The minister stated that 408 teams had been formed to enforce the prohibition of firecrackers. The Delhi Police has formed 210 teams under the supervision of the assistant commissioner of police, the Revenue Department has formed 165 teams, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee has formed 33 teams. These teams will enforce the ban on Delhi residents and, if necessary, arrest those “accused” of bursting firecrackers on Diwali.

On October 10, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the AAP government’s ban on firecrackers, but the court refused to issue any further instructions, citing that the court had already delivered a clear decision. The Supreme Court has declined to overturn the ban on firecrackers in Delhi ahead of the October 24 holiday, citing pollution and advising petitioners to instead spend their money on sweets.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin recently wrote to his Delhi colleague Arvind Kejriwal, requesting that he allow the sale of firecrackers that comply with permitted regulations. The letter comes after firework makers in Tamil Nadu criticized the AAP Delhi government’s decision to prohibit the sale of fireworks in the state.

According to the manufacturers, the prohibition will hurt them for the third year in a row, affecting 15% of their sales. Stalin reminded Kejriwal in his letter that bursting crackers as a form of celebration is an internationally accepted practice, especially in highly environmentally concerned countries.

Haryana

Manohar Lal Khattar, the Chief Minister of Haryana, has said that all non-green crackers will be banned this Diwali. All around the state, appropriate locations have been selected for the selling of these green firecrackers. He went on to say that even with the holiday spirit, we must take care of the environment. Due to growing pollution in the state, Haryana banned the use of firecrackers this month. This decision was made in response to instructions issued by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and the National Green Tribunal. “There will be a blanket ban on standard firecrackers on Diwali; only green crackers will be permitted,” ML Khattar stated.

Punjab

The Punjab government which has apparently failed in dealing with the issue of stubble burning which is the major contributor to increased pollution levels has announced a two-hour window for bursting firecrackers on Diwali, October 24, and has approved the usage of Green Crackers on the occasion. Notably, on October 12, the Punjab government issued guidelines allowing residents to use fireworks during Diwali and other festivities over the following three months. According to the guidelines, residents will be allowed to burst firecrackers only for two hours on Diwali, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.

West Bengal

On October 11, the Calcutta High Court ordered that no fireworks other than green crackers with QR codes be sold or used in West Bengal. The court has ordered state pollution control board (PCB) representatives and police officers to inspect firecrackers that would be sold in the market and confiscate those that do not match the acceptable requirements.

Banning of firecrackers by several states ahead of Diwali is not only a major setback for the fireworks industry but also spoils the spirit of the celebration of the festival.","['Opindia Staff', 'Https', 'Staff Reporter At Opindia']",2022-10-22 10:28:55+00:00,https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/firecrackers.jpg,[],[],,"['Warangal', 'Bela', 'Koheda']","['Adilabad', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Nizamabad']"
"Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur account for 60 per cent of stubble burning cases in Punjab","By PTI

CHANDIGARH: Punjab recorded nearly 3,700 stubble burning incidents between September 15 and October 22 and about 60 per cent of these were in three districts of Majha region -- Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur.

According to data from the Ludhiana-based Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Tarn Taran reported 1,034 stubble burning incidents, maximum in the state, followed by Amritsar 895 and Gurdaspur 324.

The state overall witnessed 3,696 cases of stubble burning during the period.

Paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana is one of the reasons behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital region in October and November. And, the situation is often aggravated by bursting of firecrackers around Diwali.

Paddy harvest is complete in 35 per cent of the total cultivated area in Punjab and it will pick up in a day or two, said an official of the state agriculture department.

Crop harvesting got delayed by at least 10 days because of untimely rain in September. Punjab has around 30.84 lakh hectares of paddy area in this Kharif season.

Other districts which have so far seen stubble burning incidents include Patiala (246), Kapurthala (214), Ferozepur (187), Jalandhar (169) and Ludhiana (131).

Pathankot is the only district in the state which has not seen a single stubble burning incident so far this season.

Farm fire incidents have picked up as the state has seen a four-fold increase in such cases since October 10. Till October 10, the state had witnessed 718 stubble burning incidents.

However, the situation is marginally better this year as of now in comparison to stubble burning incidents in the last two years.

Punjab had reported 10,785 and 5,438 such incidents till October 22 in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

On October 22, Punjab saw 582 active farm fire incidents. However, on the same day in 2020 and 2021, the state had seen 1,341 and 1,111 such incidents, according to the data.

Farm fires continued despite the state government assuring more crop residue management machines and launching massive awareness programmes against stubble burning.

As the window for the cultivation of wheat (Rabi crop) is very short after the paddy harvest, farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue. Punjab generates around 180 lakh tonne of paddy straw annually.

The state recorded 71,304 such fire incidents in 2021; 76,590 in 2020; 55,210 in 2019; and 50,590 in 2018 with many districts, including Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda and Amritsar, witnessing large-scale stubble burning.

FCI to Purchase 8 lakh tonnes of Fortified Parboiled Rice from Telangana,"The Centre would supplement supplies to its flagship programme, which aims to provide fortified rice (rice fortified with iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12) through the public distribution system. The scheme, which was launched late last year, is being implemented in stages across the country.

Telangana has agreed to supply the Centre with 8 lakh tonnes of fortified parboiled rice. This is in addition to the 6 lt it agreed to buy from the state. Following a squabble earlier this year, the Centre stated that it will not purchase parboiled rice produced in the state during the rabi season.

It stated that it will only purchase white (raw) rice, which the State believes will result in losses because paddy-to-rice conversion in rabi is poor due to grain breakage.

The situation became more complicated when two weeks of nonstop rain and flooding damaged paddy stocks stored in mills across the state. Concerned about the possibility of losing approximately 5 litres of paddy that had become soaked in water, the State Government approached the Centre, asking if it could supply fortified parboiled rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI).

Responding to the State's July 30 request, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution wrote to Telangana's Civil Supplies Commissioner, agreeing to purchase an additional 8 lakh tonnes of fortified parboiled rice.

"Stubble burning: Centre to offer financial assistance for torrefaction, pelletisation plants","By PTI

NEW DELHI: The central government has said a one-time financial assistance will be given to individuals and companies to set up torrefaction and pelletisation plants to ensure a regular supply of paddy straw for co-firing in thermal power plants and industries.

The setting up of these plants will help resolve the problem of stubble burning and generate income for farmers, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said at a workshop on ""Guidelines for grant of one-time financial support for establishment of pelletisation and torrefaction plants to promote utilisation of paddy straw"" on Thursday.

Along with unfavourable meteorological conditions, paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November.

Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato.

While pelletisation means converting paddy straw into pellets which can be used in thermal power plants and industries as fuel, torrefaction is a process to improve physical properties and chemical composition of biomass.

According to government data, Punjab and Haryana generate around 27 million tonnes of paddy straw a year, of which around 6.4 million tonnes is not managed.

To address the issue of air pollution and to reduce the carbon footprint of thermal power plants and industries, the government had earlier mandated co-firing of 5 to 10 per cent of biomass along with coal.

Though there is a demand for biomass by power plants, ""The supply is on the lower side due to slow/limited growth of aggregators/suppliers"", the government noted.

""Therefore, there is a need to facilitate setting up of pelletisation plants so that paddy straw is utilised and the issue of crop burning and pollution is further addressed,"" read the guidelines prepared by the Union Environment Ministry.

"To Help Struggling Farmers, Telangana Man Invents Paddy-Planting Machine with Help of YouTube","Kammari Nagaswamy, an ITI graduate, decided to help the struggling farmers in his district by inventing the paddy-planting machine that plants five rows of paddy at once and reduces the need for physical labor.

They say that need is the mother of innovation, and the paddy-planting machine created by a young farmer, an ITI pass out, in Telangana would do full justice to the phrase. The one-of-a-kind idea has played a major role in rescuing locals from financial challenges and providing a boost to the farming community.

Kammari Nagaswamy, is a resident of Kachapur village in Bhiknoor Mandal in Kamareddy district, Telangana. He has graduated from ITI and supported his family financially by working in a private firm in Hyderabad.

Nagaswamy lost his work due to the life-threatening Covid-19 outbreak. Nagaswamy noted a scarcity of agricultural labor to plant the paddy manually. He couldn't fathom the farmers' struggles while growing paddy. He then decided to take matters into his own hands, literally, by investing in his own paddy planting equipment.

He started watching YouTube DIY instructional videos to teach himself and had a clear aim in mind: create a machine. Despite the cooperation of his brother Sandeep Kumar, Nagaswamy needed a year to develop a paddy planting machine. He spent Rs 50,000 on the construction. The device was outfitted with two 12-volt batteries and a BRTS motor.

According to Nagaswamy, the machine runs on batteries, removing the need for physical labor. The equipment will plant five rows of paddy at once.

Two rods are also attached to the engine in order to accommodate a certain amount of paddy to sow, filling up five rows on the farm field at the same time.",[],None,https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/74839/paddy-planting-machine.jpg,[],[],,"['Kamareddy', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
Punjab Govt offers incentives to industry for using paddy straw as fuel,"Punjab Govt offers incentives to industry for using paddy straw as fuel

Patiala, Sept 3 (KNN) In order to curb stubble burning in Punjab, the state government has decided to provide incentives to industries that agree to use paddy stubble as fuel.

Senior officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) said the government had decided to provide cumulative incentives of Rs 25 crore to 50 industries on a first-come-first-served basis.

As per reports, currently, eight industries have agreed to use paddy stubble as fuel.

“Industries using boilers will be encouraged to use paddy straw as fuel. Further, the government will give non-fiscal incentives to such industries. For example, they will get panchayat land on a 33-year lease to store paddy straw,” said officials.

To prevent farm fires, the state government will also mark red entries in the revenue records of farmers who burn stubble and do not even pay environmental compensation.

“Starting this season, we will have more than 8,500 officers in the field. Red entries will be made in the records of farmers who set their fields on fire,” said PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg.

Currently, the Punjab government is trying to bring more industrial units under the ambit of the scheme to ensure minimum farm fire cases.

An official of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said authorities will review the situation in the evening and may take a call on implementing anti-air pollution measures under stage three of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) which include a ban on construction and demolition activities in NCR, except on essential projects, and restrictions on the plying of BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four wheelers.

The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi stood at 398 at 11 am, worsening from 357 at 4 pm on Friday. It was 354 on Thursday, 271 on Wednesday, 302 on Tuesday and 312 on Monday (Diwali).

Anand Vihar (AQI 454) was the most polluted place in the capital. Wazirpur (439), Narela (423), Ashok Vihar (428), Vivek Vihar (427) and Jahangirpuri (438) were among the monitoring stations that recorded ""severe"" air quality.

The air quality in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (381), Noida (392), Greater Noida (398), Gurugram (360) and Faridabad (391) also inched closer to the ""severe"" category.

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".

According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5 was above 400 micrograms per cubic metre at 11 am, around seven times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre, in many areas.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said calm winds prevailed at night. Moderate wind speed (up to 8 kmph) is predicted during the day, it added.

Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 15.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 31 degrees Celsius.

In cold conditions, pollutants are trapped close to the ground because of low mixing height -- the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air.

A CAQM official said a call on implementing curbs under stage three of GRAP is likely to be taken on Saturday evening.

If AQI turns ""severe"", authorities are required to enforce a ban on construction and demolition activities in NCR, except on essential projects (like railways, metros, airports, ISBTs, national security/defence-related projects of national importance) and non-polluting activities such as plumbing, carpentry, interior decoration and electrical works.

Brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers not operating on clean fuels, and mining and associated activities in NCR will also be banned.

State governments in Delhi-NCR may also impose restrictions on BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four wheelers under stage three.

GRAP is a set of anti-air pollution measures followed in the capital and its vicinity according to the severity of the situation.

According to GRAP, air quality in Delhi-NCR is classified under four different stages: Stage I - 'Poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II - 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III - 'Severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV - 'Severe Plus' (AQI >450).

SAFAR, a forecasting agency under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, predicted that the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution is likely to increase in the coming days.

The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 pollution has so far remained low (up to 7 per cent) due to a prolonged rain spell in early October and slow transport-level winds which were not strong enough to carry smoke from farm fires to the national capital.

The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) reported 2,067 farm fires in Punjab on Friday, the highest so far this season. It logged 124 and 34 cases of stubble burning in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, on Friday.

Along with unfavourable meteorological conditions, paddy straw burning in adjoining states is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November. Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and vegetables.

As per the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Punjab reported 71,304 farm fires between September 15 and November 30 last year and 83,002 farm fires in the corresponding period in 2020.

Last year, the share of farm fires in Delhi's PM 2.5 pollution peaked to 48 per cent on November 7.",[],2022-10-29 14:15:00+05:30,https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-pchso0bagm34ipgujp4dlsfeb5-20221029141141.Medi.jpeg,[],[],,"['Kamareddy', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
Stubble Burning: States Asked To Ensure Non-Stop Supply Of Paddy Straw For Ex-Situ Utilisation,"New Delhi: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has asked Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to formulate a policy to ensure continuous supply of paddy straw for ex-situ utilisation and co-firing in thermal power plants. Co-firing of paddy straw pellets (up to 10 per cent) with coal in thermal power plants is one of the important ex-situ stubble management strategies. Paddy straw is also used as in waste-to-energy plants, brick kilns and end products such as pellets, bio-fuels (bio-ethanol, compressed bio gas), particle board, panel furniture and packaging material.

Paddy straw burning in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November.

Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato.

Punjab generates around 20 million tons of paddy straw annually. Haryana and eight NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh produce around 7.5 million tons and 0.75 million tons of paddy straw on an average.

The National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), a potential major user of paddy straw in thermal power plants, had earlier told the commission that it is technically feasible to co-fire paddy straw-based pellets (5 per cent to 10 per cent) along with coal.

It informed that efforts have been initiated for the use up to 5 million tons of biomass pellets per annum in 17 plants.

The air quality panel has now directed the states to formulate a policy framework for “ensuring assured and continuous supply of raw material to plants utilising paddy crop residue”.

It also asked the states to utilise paddy straw pellets in their own thermal power plants in the NCR region “since huge quality of straw is available proximate to TPPs”.

States have been advised to develop low-cost, long-term paddy straw storage facilities and facilitate setting up of paddy straw pelletising units at strategic geographic locations to optimise supply chain logistics.

NHRC seeks detailed report from Punjab on stubble burning,"Chandigarh [India], November 11 (ANI): The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Thursday held a high-level review meeting via video conference with Punjab Chief Secretary Vijay Kumar Janjua and state government officials regarding the increasing air pollution and sought a detailed report on the stubble burning in the state.

According to an official release, the NHRC expressed strong concern over stubble burning cases in North India, especially in Punjab as the air quality has turned ‘severe’ in many cities and has been affecting the health of the people as well as putting seriously impacting on those with existing illnesses.

The commission said that incidents of stubble burning should be strictly curtailed. It said that if the situation was not improved, a heavy penalty would be imposed on Punjab.

On this occasion, the Commission reviewed the cases related to stubble management in Punjab from the Chief Secretary and also sought some data in this regard.

The Chief Secretary said that under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, the entire machinery of the state is putting efforts to reduce the incidence of stubble burning this year and farmers are being encouraged and made aware not to burn stubble.

The Chief Secretary said that every week a meeting is being held with all Deputy Commissioners and higher officials of Punjab for stubble management so that effective measures can be taken to prevent stubble burning.

The Chief Secretary said that more focus has been given by the authorities on those hot spots in the villages where the cases of farm fires were detected in the previous years.

Apart from this, a senior IAS officer has been placed in charge of each 23 districts of the state and they have been directed to work at the grass root level to closely review the stubble management and prevent stubble burning cases, the Chief Secretary said.

The Chief Secretary appealed to the farmers not to burn stubble under any circumstances for the healthy future of children and youth and to cooperate with the government for its management. (ANI)

( Image Source : PTI )

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to accord urgent hearing to a PIL seeking fresh guidelines on stubble burning to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR, saying some issues are not ""judicially amenable"" and stressing the need for ""genuine solutions"".

A bench comprising Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices Hima Kohli and J B Pardiwala asked lawyer Shashank Shekhar Jha, who filed the PIL, whether banning stubble burning alone would help in curbing air pollution.

“So what is your solution to Delhi pollution,” the CJI asked Jha.

On being told that stubble burning is causing pollution, the bench said, “So we ban it? Will that stop? Do we enforce it against every farmer? Let us think of some genuine solutions. There are things, (where) courts can do something and there are something that courts cannot do. We are to look at the judicial aspects.” ""Some matters, courts can look into and some it cannot. Since they are not judicially amenable... We have heard you and it would not be taken up now,” the CJI said.

The PIL has sought a direction to schools, colleges and government and private offices to go virtual/online.

The lawyer alleged that the problem of pollution comes up every year and there is a serious threat on the life and liberty due to the smog in Delhi-National Capital Region.

The plea has also sought appointment of a ""high-level committee"" under the chair-ship of a retired Supreme Court judge to tackle the air pollution crisis due to stubble burning.

Delhi govt starts free spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer to prevent stubble burning,"By PTI

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Tuesday started free spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer in agricultural fields to prevent stubble burning in the capital.

Prepared by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) here, the Pusa bio-decomposer is a microbial solution which can turn paddy straw into manure in 15-20 days.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai, who sprayed the bio-decomposer in a field in Burari, said the spraying of the solution got delayed due to rains earlier this month.

The solution will be sprayed on 5,000 acres of basmati and non-basmati fields in the capital this year.

The Pusa bio-decomposer was used on 4,300 acres of land belonging to 844 farmers in Delhi last year.

In 2020, 310 farmers had used it on 1,935 acres of land.

The Delhi government has set up 21 teams to create awareness about the effectiveness of bio-decomposer and register farmers who want to use the solution in their fields.

According to officials, spraying of bio-decomposer costs just Rs 30 per acre.

In 2021, a third-party audit conducted to ascertain the impact of the microbial solution in Delhi showed that it was 95 percent effective, following which Kejriwal had requested the Centre to distribute it free in neighbouring states.

Along with unfavourable meteorological conditions, paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November.

Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and vegetables.

According to the IARI data, Punjab had reported 71,304 farm fires between September 15 and November 30 last year and 83,002 farm fires in the corresponding period in 2020.

Last year, the share of farm fires in Delhi's PM 2.5 pollution had peaked to 48 per cent on November 7.

"​Capital Chokehold | 27mn Ton Paddy Straw, Short Sowing Window: Farmers Race Against Time for Harvesting","As winter approaches, Delhi is bracing itself for plummeting air quality, made worse by stubble burning in neighbouring states. Besides being a health and environmental hazard, the issue is also a political one with the Aam Aadmi Party in power in both Delhi and Punjab. In this series, News18 studies the situation on ground, explores solutions with experts and attempts to answer if Delhiites will breathe easy this season.

Part 4 of 5

As the long rainy spell finally comes to an end over North-west India, paddy harvesting has gathered steam with farmers now racing against time to reap paddy sown on nearly 46 lakh hectares of land across Punjab, Haryana and parts of the National Capital Region (NCR).

With winter also beginning to set in, the conditions are now becoming conducive for air quality to worsen over the national capital.

PART 1 | Before Delhi, the Smoke Consumes Us. But Can’t Give Up Burning Stubble: Sangrur Farmers

While Delhi is breathing well this October so far with Air Quality Index (AQI) of 119, which lies in the moderate category, it is likely to worsen over the coming days as temperatures plummet further. According to the forecast issued by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the AQI may rise further as peak wind speed is likely to be ~ 8-12 km/h with moderate dispersion of pollutants.

According to India Metrological Department (IMD), dry weather is now likely to prevail over North-west India, with a weak probability of rains, encouraging farmers to complete the harvesting process. The southwest monsoon is also set to withdraw from all remaining parts of North-west India, and more parts of Central India in the next two-three days.

IMPACT OF STUBBLE BURNING

While nearly 1,100 incidents of farm fires have already been reported across Punjab, Haryana and NCR since September 15, their current impact over the air quality in Delhi has been negligible. The rains have washed away pollutants, but they have also led to foggy conditions which could further impact air quality with rise in PM2.5 and PM10 expected ahead of Diwali.

PART 2 | Delhi’s Dream of Clean Air Hinges on Punjab’s Largest Biogas Plant. Can AAP Govt Deliver?

The crop fires too are likely to increase as harvesting gains momentum. As many as 273 farm fire incidents were reported in the last three days, with a majority of them from Punjab where the weather remained largely dry. While the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s overall air pollution is considered to be 10-13 per cent, it can go up depending on the wind speeds and increase in fire counts.

A ton of paddy straw generates nearly three kilograms of particulate matter, two kilograms of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), 60 kilograms of Carbon Monoxide (CO), 199 kilograms of ash, and nearly 1,460 kilograms of Carbon Dioxide, which creates a deadly concoction of pollutants in the air. According to experts, it also impacts the soil fertility and its natural biome.

27 MILLION TON PADDY STRAW

As per the estimate, nearly 27.6 million tons of paddy straw is likely to be generated this Kharif season, with the largest share from Punjab at 19.9 million tons, seven million tons from Haryana and around 0.67 million tons from parts of Uttar Pradesh under the National Capital Region (NCR).

PART 3 | ‘How Can We Set Fire to Field That Feeds Us?’ In Punjab, Some Are Doing Their Bit for Clean Air

“Agricultural residual burning is a matter of serious concern due to its adverse impact on air quality and health of people. It is a gigantic task to collect, mobilise and then dispose of over 27 million tons of paddy straw – all of which comes out in a short period of 25-30 days,” said Dr MM Kutty, chairperson of Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM).

However, the most concerning is the non-Basmati variety of paddy, which constitutes most of the paddy sown in the region. As per data, of the total 46 lakh hectare of land under paddy in Punjab, Haryana and NCR, 13.5 lakh hectares is covered by Basmati, while a staggering 32.5 lakh hectares is non-basmati.

PART 5 | Caught in Political Slugfest, Will Delhi’s Smog Story Be Any Different This Year?

“Most of Basmati can be managed through in-situ management. But in case of non-Basmati, the Silica content is very high, which prevents its usage even as fodder for the cattle. So, we are trying to manage it systematically through alternatives like using it as an economical resource for biomass plants, waste-to-energy units, packaging industry and co-firing in thermal power plants which can help us to reduce the consumption of coal. We have to control farm fires and reduce air pollution, but we also need to make agriculture practices more sustainable,” he said.

The Basmati varieties also require less time to mature and are harvested early, giving farmers more time to sow the next crop.

As per the government data, as many as 71, 304 farm fires were reported in Punjab, 6,987 in Haryana, and 252 in NCR-UP last year. An analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) showed the peak 24-hour PM 2.5 levels in Delhi-NCR were ‘alarmingly high’ last winter, with its worst days being almost five times worse than average. The pollution levels had begun to cross ‘severe’ levels post October 20. This year too, the air quality is likely to deteriorate in the coming week.

Bhagwant Mann govt acts tough on stubble burning! 4 agri officers suspended for negligence,"The Punjab government on Sunday suspended four officials of the Agriculture Department as stubble burning continued unabated in the agrarian state with 1,761 fresh incidents.The development came as the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution rose to 26 per cent, the highest this year, with forecasters saying that slow wind speed and an increase in stubble burning, especially in Punjab, may make it worse. Following directions of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, Agriculture Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal placed four agriculture officers under suspension with immediate effect for dereliction of duty, an official release said.

The suspended officials are Chief Agriculture Officer (Sangrur) Harbans Singh, and agriculture officers Satish Kumar (Samana in Patiala), Harpal Singh (Chohla Sahib in Tarn Taran) and Bhupinder Singh (Patti in Tarn Taran), it said. According to Punjab Remote Sensing Centre data, 1,761 farm fires were reported in Punjab on Sunday.

Of these, Sangrur recorded the highest number of farm fires at 323, followed by 249 in Patiala, 122 in Fatehgarh Sahib, 114 in Bathinda, 110 in Tarn Taran, 107 in Ferozepur and 100 in Ludhiana, the data showed. The Punjab government has adopted a zero-tolerance policy against stubble burning and has been organising campaigns across the state to sensitise farmers not to burn stubble, the release said.

The CM had categorically asked agriculture officers to work at the grassroots level to ensure crop residue is not set ablaze, it said. But the government found these officers were not adhering to the directions, it added. During the suspension period, these four officers will report to the office of the director of Department of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, Mohali, the release stated.

From September 15 to October 30, 13,873 incidents of stubble burning were recorded in Punjab, the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre data showed. During the same period in 2020 and 2021, the state had reported 25,986 and 10,229 stubble burning incidents, respectively. Punjab had recorded 2,799 and 1,373 active fire incidents on October 30 in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

After Diwali, the state has seen a rise in the number of stubble burning incidents, with farmers setting crop residue on fire to clear their fields for sowing the next crop. Major farm fires are now being witnessed in Sangrur and Patiala in the Malwa region.

The Commission for Air Quality Management had on Thursday said the increased incidents of stubble burning in Punjab this year ""is a matter of serious concern"".

The air quality in parts of Punjab was recorded in 'moderate' and 'poor' categories, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

The air quality index (AQI) in Amritsar, Khanna, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mandi Gobindgarh and Patiala stood at 210, 171, 277, 187, 173 and 179, respectively. In parts of Haryana, the air quality was recorded in 'poor' and 'very poor' categories, the CPCB data showed.

Faridabad recorded an AQI of 383, Manesar 357, Bahadurgarh 345, Gurugram 326, Charkhi Dadri 319, Bhiwani 311, Sonipat 298, Rohtak 296, Jind 283 and Ambala 231.

Chandigarh, the common capital of Punjab and Haryana, recorded an AQI of 182. An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.",['Zee Media Bureau'],None,https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2022/10/31/1110281-stubble-burning.jpg,[],[],,"['Kamareddy', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"

"Red Chilli Prices Skyrocket In Telangana Due To Pest Attacks; Costs Rs 55,500 Per Quintal","Since January 2022, more than twenty farmers have committed suicide in Telanagana. Hundreds of farmers around the state have been hit by a pest infestation. In addition, farmers have been forced to adopt drastic measures due to their inability to repay debts.

More than 20 farmers have died by suicide in Telangana since January 2022. And the cause is ‘Chilli threats’, a pest attack that has affected hundreds of farmers across the state. And, the inability to pay back loans has pushed farmers to take the extreme step.

Human rights forum and independent organisation in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana formed a fact finding committee to investigate the issue.

“ Generally, a mirchi crop requires 1 lakh investment per acre. In addition to the family labour. This year the farmers have lost lakhs of investments in the fields and they have lost all their efforts”, says Dr. S Thirupathaiah, Human Rights Forum.

The rate of desi chilli has gone upto Rs 55,500 per quintal. This is higher than the price of one tola of gold. Compared to a year ago, the same chillies are priced at about Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 a quintal. The premiere desi variety was priced at Rs 20,000 a quintal. The price hike has been attributed to lower production across the country, increased demand in the international market and crop damage due to pests.

India’s Chilli Market

India is the world’s largest producer, consumer and exporter of chillies. Red chilli is grown extensively across Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

The desi variety is grown in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It has a high demand both in India and overseas. It is used for food flavouring and colouring and in preparation of chemicals. But, these crops are vulnerable to pest attacks.

Agricultural minister, Narendra Singh Tomar said that around 40 to 80 percent of the damage to the chilli crop in the two states was because of the pest invasion. Devi Reddy lost her husband when he consumed weedicide. Heart broken from the loss, the future of her family now seems uncertain.

“In Mahabubabad district alone, around 40,000 hectares of chilli fields have been affected by this black thrips pest. And the yield of the crops have dropped to less than 10%. Most of the farmers are scheduled tribe farmers, small and marginal farmers. They could not bear this much loss to their crops,” adds Dr. S Thirupathaiah, Human Rights Forum.

Chilli thrips is an invasive pests species that comes from SouthEast Asia. It is less than 2 mm long. It is known to infest more than 225 species of plants. This includes corn, cotton, egg plant, pepper, strawberry, tomato and ofcourse chilli.

Chilli is a high investment crop with farmers investing more than Rs 80,000 to Rs 1,00,000 per acre. And farmers in Telangana have become hopeless.

Farmers From 25 different States Arrive at Telangana to Study Agricultural Schemes,"To examine and assess the developments in the irrigation and agriculture sectors at the field level in the State, leaders, and representatives of Farmers' Associations from 25 States arrived in Hyderabad.

Under the leadership of Telangana State Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, the agriculture sector, which was previously thought of as a loss-making industry, has quickly transformed into a profitable one.

The farmers' community in other States in the nation was increasingly calling for the implementation of the Telangana government's farmer welfare schemes and the development schemes in the agriculture and related sectors.

The entire farming community was observing Telangana, which in the 75 years of India's independent history has implemented a revolutionary action plan in the agricultural sector. The farming community has expressed interest in several development welfare schemes, such as Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bhima, which offer crop incentives and boost confidence in farmers family, as well as Telangana government irrigation projects that provide abundant irrigation water supply for two crops and 24-hour quality free power.

To examine and assess the developments in the irrigation and agriculture sectors at the field level in the State, leaders and representatives of Farmers' Associations from 25 States arrived in Hyderabad.

Participating in this program are about 100 farmers from 25 different States, including Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab, Karnataka, and others. They began a field tour to examine the growth of the irrigation and agriculture sectors in Telangana state.

Farmers' association leaders told reporters that they had come to Telangana to examine the Schemes being carried out by KCR, which is known as the farmers' ""Best Friend"". The leaders declared that they will push their respective State governments to follow Telangana's lead and implement policies and schemes for farmer welfare and agricultural development. They believed that chief ministers like KCR should also serve their respective states. It is amazing that Telangana farmers are still engaged in farming as a successful business with no losses.

Himansh, a farmer's leader from Uttar Pradesh, said that KCR's provision of Rs 10,000 per acre in Rythu Bandhu assistance and Rs 5 lakh in insurance coverage to the farmer's family represents a significant change.

He complimented the CM for giving the families of martyred farmers who gave their lives in the farmers' struggle financial support.

Telangana Exports Spices Worth Around $200 million in 2020-21,"Turmeric is a valuable cash crop that is primarily grown for the expected profits it brings, which are backed by sentiment. It is regarded as a good omen crop, and despite its high production costs, farmers are encouraged to cultivate it on the smallest patch of land available.

Telangana, India's largest producer of turmeric and the second-largest producer of chillies, exported spices worth around $200 million in the 2020-21 fiscal year, representing a 37% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the past five years.

Despite producing 30% of the country's turmeric, the state contributes little to its exports. According to Drip Capital, Inc., a global trade finance company, it was chillies that drove exports from the state.

Because the terrains of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are ideal for chilli production, the two states will account for more than 60% of the country's chilli exports in 2020-21. ""Given that Covid-19 has fueled a new wave of appreciation for Ayurveda and ethnic Indian food, the demand for convenience, and people's desire to experiment with different flavours,"" said Pushkar Mukewar, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Drip Capital, ""Telangana spice exporters can leverage opportunities from these emerging trends to make their mark in the export market.""

""Given the medicinal value of turmeric and the global preference for beverages such as turmeric latte as immunity boosters, Telangana's turmeric exporters must stay up to date on market developments and innovate their products,"" he said.

This, he claims, will help strengthen 'Brand India' around the world and allow spice traders to better cater to international markets. Turmeric production fell by nearly one lakh tonnes last year to 11 lakh tonnes, according to trade sources, due to lower production in states such as Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.

Turmeric is a valuable cash crop that is primarily grown for the expected profits it brings, which are backed by sentiment. It is regarded as a good omen crop, and despite its high production costs, farmers are encouraged to cultivate it on the smallest patch of land available.

Telangana is the country's largest producer of turmeric. In Telangana, the four districts (formerly) viz. Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, and Adilabad account for approximately 90% of the state's turmeric production, and this area houses the country's important turmeric markets.",[],None,https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/74186/h.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
Will AAP govt in Punjab help Delhi get rid of air pollution?,"New Delhi: With the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) set to form the government in Punjab, can Delhi expect to breathe fresh air in the winters?

Will Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has all along blamed stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab for the air pollution in the national capital, ensure that his party’s government does not let ‘parali’ (stubble) burning add to Delhi’s problem this winter?

With a very small window available for the farmers in Punjab and Haryana between harvesting paddy and sowing of wheat, every year, the beginning of the winter season witnesses agro-waste burning in Haryana and Punjab, and the meteorological conditions bring that pollution towards Delhi.

The situation worsens further as and when the cold/fog condition aids in stagnation of the pollutants.

Perception over the years has been that it is only the ‘parali’ burning in the fields of Punjab and Haryana which is responsible for Delhi’s air pollution, whereas science has established other sources of emissions too.

Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, an advocacy NGO working on the issue of air pollution and climate change, said: “If they (AAP government) really take it as a top priority, if they can really set up some kind of a governance mechanism for better coordination quickly, it will be a good possibility that can be explored.”

AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “As we have done in Delhi, we would push for bio-decomposters in Punjab. We would think of offering subsidy or give them for free to the farmers and also include machines such as happy seeders that can help tackle the problem.”

When his attention was drawn towards the problem of collection of agro-waste from the farmers’ fields, Bhardwaj said, “We will need to work it out with the industry that utilises agro-waste to come up with products and push them to collect them from the farmers’ fields.”

Delhi Minister Satyender Jain said, “Now that AAP is in power in Punjab too, we will plan better and coordinate better.”

However, it is easier said than done as stubble burning is just one part of the larger picture. The sources of emission for Delhi include transport, power plants around Delhi, local sources, brick kilns and of course, stubble burning.

Khosla agreed that crop burning is part of the problem and said, “But when it is a problem, it is very significant in terms of contribution, as it can go to as high as 40 per cent. In terms of public perception, it captures a lot of attention as this is a very significant issue.

“So, given the enormity of the problem, addressing the complex issue of stubble burning will be a big task. It might be small in the overall picture, but in absolute terms, it is a big problem and it won’t be a bad idea if AAP can address it in some measures.”",['Indo-Asian News Service'],2022-03-11 17:34:54+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pollution_Delhi.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
Delhi's AQI airing concerns- The New Indian Express,"Ujwal Jalali By

Express News Service

The soaring levels of air pollution during the winter season is a serious problem with which India's capital city — Delhi — grapples every year. Even though there are a number of reasons that add to the capital woes like vehicles, industries, power plants, waste burning etc, yet, the politicians have umpteen times blamed the farmers of neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana for burning their crop residue. But the blame-game ain't the solution, stern action that guarantees a long-lasting solution was to be taken on the ground.

Taking serious note of the problem, the government last year decided to set up a commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and adjoining areas. The statutory authority — the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region (NCR) and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) — has been the sole authority with jurisdiction over matters such as air quality management.

Just a few days ago, as the pollution levels started increasing in the national capital, the CAQM immediately swung into action and issued statutory directions to strictly implement measures under the first stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).

Even the Delhi government is not behind and has bolstered its fight against pollution by launching a month-long intensive anti-dust campaign. This apart, the city government has also announced a Winter Action Plan under which a range of actions, from setting up a war room in the Delhi Secretariat to forming 586 teams to monitor the implementation of this campaign, has been done.So is there a hope that Delhi this time will see more coordinated action to tackle the menace of air pollution?

Experts doubtful

The smoke that emanates from the burning of paddy stubble in the neighbouring states contributes to almost 15 per cent of air pollution in Delhi. Experts say that the farm fires are yet to begin in Punjab and Haryana and it is too early to predict anything.

""Farmers are yet to burn the crop residue. Moreover, the incessant rains in Delhi-NCR have already plummeted the air pollution levels. It will be too early to say that the city residents may get any kind of respite from the air pollution,"" said Avikal Somvanshi, Senior Programme Manager, Centre for Science and Environment.

He said the rains may soon stop and pollution levels may soar during the month's end. On the steps taken by the government, Somvanshi said,""I don't see any dramatic or drastic action taken by the government. Even the Delhi government's 15-point action plan is similar to previous years.""

""The problem is that we get attentive only during the winter season when the pollution levels are at peak. The Graded Action Plan is an emergency plan but if we have to tackle the menace, we need to reduce the base pollution in Delhi by implementing the comprehensive action plan throughout the year,"" Somvanshi said.""Delhi cannot control the pollution coming from neighbouring states but it can certainly reduce the base pollution that is generated within the city,"" the air pollution expert added.

Story of smog towers

After AQI levels escalated following the annual episode of stubble burning, the Supreme Court in 2020 instructed the Delhi government and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to erect two smog towers in the city.

The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) got on board, by submitting a proposal to the CPCB. The smog towers under testing mode were to be installed at Anand Viharand Connaught Place by April 2020 but due to the subsequent lockdowns, the deadline was flouted. Finally, two smog towers came up in 2021.

It was claimed that the towers can purify the air in a one-km radius around the structure, at a rate of around 1,000 cubic meters per second. Both towers, identical in shape and design, are functional since September 2021. So have the towers reduced pollution levels? India took the decision of installing smog towers following China’s footsteps, but experts say China is implementing strong pollution control rules across sectors, which India hasn’t.

“These smog towers, which were first-of-their-kind, were installed as a research project and initially we were not able to attain its full efficiency in 2021,” Dr Anwar Ali Khan, senior environmental engineer at the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, said.

He said that recently, IIT-Bombay has sent some recommendations on how to attain its full efficiency. ""It was designed for 90 per cent filtration efficiency but we were able to get only 50-60 per cent efficiency during the peak pollution days, last year. Its efficiency depends upon several factors, including wind direction and wind speed,"" the senior official said.

When asked about the recommendations, Dr Anwar said, ""There were some technical gaps that had to be filled in. Like the smog towers should not be used during excess moisture in the air. So whenever there is rain, we now stop it immediately.""

“Secondly, we were told by the experts to maintain an absolute vacuum inside the tower which we were not doing initially. The whole corridor — the buffer zone — from filtration to fan-area should not have any bad air,” the official said.

He said that the smog tower can clean the air within 300-400 meters of its reach. ""This winter season will be the litmus test for the tower and we will check its efficiency as we have adopted the measures recommended by IIT-Bombay,"" Dr Anwar averred.

Costing around Rs 25 lakh, each tower is having 4,800 filters (1,200 filters in one direction) that are supposed to be changed every 3-4 months. The reason behind the high cost of filters is they are being imported from the US.

""Now we are planning to develop and manufacture these filters in India. IIT-Bombay is currently in talks with 3 vendors that will manufacture them in India. This will drastically reduce its cost,"" the official said. It has been predicted by IIT-Bombay that this year Delhi's smog tower will be able to achieve 80 per cent of its efficiency during the upcoming winter season.

Bad air from neighbours

Air pollution is hard to be mitigated since it is a multi-dimensional problem — industry, vehicular, biomass/waste burning, dust all contribute significantly, and each has its own political, regulatory, and technical challenges.

What always remains the talk of the town is the burning of paddy straw by the farmers of neighbouring states and a blame game begins. As per the experts, Punjab and Haryana alone generate 30 million tonnes of paddy straw every year, of which only a small fraction is used. But still, the stubble contributes at least 15 per cent to the city's total air pollution.

However, what is different this winter and giving hope to affected residents across the region is that instead of the annual inter-state political blame game, the Aam Aadmi Party-led governments, both in the states of Punjab and Delhi, can offer a coordinated solution to effectively tackle this problem. Last year, Punjab recorded 71,296 incidents of farm fires while on 37,302 sites no farm fire was observed. District Ferozepur topped the list with 6288 incidents, followed by Ludhiana, Moga, Patiala, and Sangrur.

Solution for stubble?

Rome was not built in a day and neither the stubble burning issue — which ultimately leads to the problem of air pollution — can be tackled in a short span of time. Mechanised farming — may be the first approach to tackle the problem and farmers can use a ‘Baler’ to clear their fields from the paddy straw.

The Baler is an implement used as a tractor attachment to convert crop residue like hay, flax straws, etc. into bales that are later used for various purposes such as feeding animals, haylage, etc. Baler makes the crop residue easier to store and transport. The price of baler in India ranges from Rs 4-80 lakhs.

To address air pollution and to subsidise machinery required for the management of crop residue, a Central Sector scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanisation for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ is being implemented from 2018-19.

Under this scheme financial assistance at 50 per cent of the cost of machinery is provided to the farmers for the purchase of identified crop residue management machinery.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is also promoting biomass co-firing for the recovery of energy that promotes the setting up of biomass pellets and briquettes manufacturing units. This apart, Pusa Decomposer Technology developed by ICAR - Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), is also being used by the farmers.

In another week’s time, GRAP, the Graded Response Action Plan a set of anti-air pollution measures followed according to the severity of the situation, would come into force. It’s a long list of directions to prevent pollution but the document has largely remained silent on how to grapple with pollution in the city from stubble burning in Punjab.

The withdrawal of the monsoon leads to a drop in wind speed. This comes at a time when crop stubble is burnt in the fields of Punjab and the wind direction changes to the northwest.

This leads to a build-up of pollutants in the air, especially in the national Capital. GRAP is being introduced from October 1, a fortnight before the use start of stubble burning in Punjab and the complete withdrawal of Monsoon.

Last year there was a Congress government in Punjab and AAP government in Delhi. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had claimed that scientists at Pusa under his guidance had invented a technique which would end stubble burning. He had promised that if AAP formed a government in Punjab, there were would be no stubble fire.

Now we have an AAP government in Delhi led by Arvind Kejriwal and an AAP government in Punjab led by Bhagwant Mann. Both governments are known to work in close coordination and it’s expected that they would work together to ensure that pollution caused due to stubble fire remains under control. However, it’s the efficacy of the technique developed at Pusa which is causing concern, as dissolving the crop stubble may not prove to be a substitute for burning it.

For this process of stubble decomposition, four Pusa capsules have to be dissolved in water to make a 25-litre solution, which is enough to spray on one hectare of land. After the solution is sprayed, it takes about 20 to 25 days for the crop remnants to decompose.

In the National Capital Region (NCR), crop burning is thought to contribute as much as 42% of all particulate matter in the air.

In the neighbouring state of Haryana, which falls in the way of the route taken by winds from Punjab to Delhi, PM2.5 and PM10 (a larger but also harmful form of particulate matter) rise to 2-3 times higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard limits during the burning season.

This problem is about 10 years old when the government decided to defer the paddy sowing season from April to June in view of groundwater depletion.

The irrigation of the crop was made totally dependent on Monsoon rains, which now lead to delays in the harvest of paddy crops. This in turn has shortened the interval between the paddy harvesting and wheat crop sowing period.

To hasten the dissolution of paddy stubble, the farmers have taken to burning to make up for the lost time. Although in 2015, stubble burning was banned, the government could not implement it on the ground given the resistance from the farm community. Now a solution is sought to be provided through Pusa capsules. There are two cautions about Pusa capsules, it would take, as the producers claim, 20-25 days to dissolve, a time period which the farmers may not be able to afford.

Second, crop stubble is also used as cattle feed. The stubble on the fields is burnt only after enough has been stored for the livestock. Pusa capsules spray may not leave anything for the cattle.

Nevertheless, the government in Delhi hopefully manages sufficient supplies of the capsules for its counterpart in Punjab so that it reaches farmers tilling thousands of acreages of green field. It’s going to be not only a test of technology but also supply management.

In another week’s time, GRAP, the Graded Response Action Plan a set of anti-air pollution measures followed according to the severity of the situation, would come into force. It’s a long list of directions to prevent pollution but the document has largely remained silent on how to grapple with pollution in the city from stubble burning in Punjab. The withdrawal of the monsoon leads to a drop in wind speed. This comes at a time when crop stubble is burnt in the fields of Punjab and the wind direction changes to the northwest. This leads to a build-up of pollutants in the air, especially in the national Capital. GRAP is being introduced from October 1, a fortnight before the use start of stubble burning in Punjab and the complete withdrawal of Monsoon. Last year there was a Congress government in Punjab and AAP government in Delhi. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had claimed that scientists at Pusa under his guidance had invented a technique which would end stubble burning. He had promised that if AAP formed a government in Punjab, there were would be no stubble fire. Now we have an AAP government in Delhi led by Arvind Kejriwal and an AAP government in Punjab led by Bhagwant Mann. Both governments are known to work in close coordination and it’s expected that they would work together to ensure that pollution caused due to stubble fire remains under control. However, it’s the efficacy of the technique developed at Pusa which is causing concern, as dissolving the crop stubble may not prove to be a substitute for burning it. For this process of stubble decomposition, four Pusa capsules have to be dissolved in water to make a 25-litre solution, which is enough to spray on one hectare of land. After the solution is sprayed, it takes about 20 to 25 days for the crop remnants to decompose. In the National Capital Region (NCR), crop burning is thought to contribute as much as 42% of all particulate matter in the air. In the neighbouring state of Haryana, which falls in the way of the route taken by winds from Punjab to Delhi, PM2.5 and PM10 (a larger but also harmful form of particulate matter) rise to 2-3 times higher than the National Ambient Air Quality Standard limits during the burning season. This problem is about 10 years old when the government decided to defer the paddy sowing season from April to June in view of groundwater depletion. The irrigation of the crop was made totally dependent on Monsoon rains, which now lead to delays in the harvest of paddy crops. This in turn has shortened the interval between the paddy harvesting and wheat crop sowing period. To hasten the dissolution of paddy stubble, the farmers have taken to burning to make up for the lost time. Although in 2015, stubble burning was banned, the government could not implement it on the ground given the resistance from the farm community. Now a solution is sought to be provided through Pusa capsules. There are two cautions about Pusa capsules, it would take, as the producers claim, 20-25 days to dissolve, a time period which the farmers may not be able to afford. Second, crop stubble is also used as cattle feed. The stubble on the fields is burnt only after enough has been stored for the livestock. Pusa capsules spray may not leave anything for the cattle.

Rai asks for final plan to fight winter pollution by September 15,"September 06, 2022 12:46 am | Updated 12:47 am IST

New Delhi:

The Delhi government will do more than what has been prescribed by the Centre’s air quality panel, to curb air pollution in the city during winter, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Monday.

The Minister said that departments have been asked to submit a final plan to fight air pollution to the Environment Department by September 15.

“Mainly 15 focus points have been identified under the Winter Action Plan on which the government will work in the coming days. On the basis of this, the next winter action plan will be prepared,” Mr. Rai said.

The 15 points include checking stubble burning, dust pollution, and vehicular pollution. The final Winter Action Plan will be prepared on the basis of suggestions submitted by the departments.",[],2022-09-05 19:16:59+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/30l00l/article65854922.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/IMG_GOPAL_RAI_DELHI_2_1_PI9VOGQ8.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
An alternative to stubble burning,"Global food productivity gradually diminishes on account of deteriorating soil quality, climate change impacts such as acidification, desertification, and generational use of harmful chemical pesticides and insecticides. There is an eminent need for research and innovation in sustainable, scalable and economically viable farming techniques.

Biochar in this context presents itself as a unique, organic opportunity which can also reduce the malice of stubble burning and its multifarious impacts on public health. While every gardening enthusiast is aware of the need for NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium) fertilizer, another important element imperative for farming is Carbon. Carbon increases soil fertility of acidic soil and its agricultural productivity and protects the soil against some foliar and soil borne diseases like collar disease and root rot.

Studies indicate that soil in tropical regions has a poorer Carbon retention as compared to the temperate region. Stubble burning, scientifically, adds to this carbon content, but results in increased air pollution in the atmosphere. Biochar is a rich in carbon, fine grained residue obtained by pyrolysis of biomass. A stroll on the streets of our country can acquaint us to a wide variety of biomass. Typically, biomass includes plant and agricultural residues like straw, husk, peels, bagasse etc, or animal waste. This biomass is then subject to a process called Pyrolysis which involves direct thermal decomposition or baking in low or absence of oxygen.

The biomass is subjected to large amount of heat, depending on the type of biomass. The temperature could be as high as 500 degree Celsius. First evaporation occurs and the water is lost from the biomass. Then the volatile compounds escape due to the high temperature leaving behind a black porous solid, rich in carbon. Pyrolysis retains more than 50 per cent of the carbon of the initial biomass whereas typical stubble burning method retains less than 2 per cent of the carbon. Other residue left behind is a brown coloured liquid called bio oil and syngas. Both these serve as clean replacements to fossil fuels. Bio oil can be directly used as a fuel in boilers or treated and used to produce bulk chemicals – alkanes, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose etc, which are otherwise typically extracted from crude oil or natural gas.

Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, can be used during the production of synthetic diesel. Biomass is rich in macro nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium etc. These nutrients are usually carried into biochar based on the conditions used during the pyrolysis process. For example, in spite of the combustion, biochar samples typically contains 21 to 370 mg kg dw-1 of Nitrogen. When biochar is mixed into the soil, it increases its alkalinity (increases the pH). This increases the nitrification (conversion of nitrogen to nitrates, plants are only able to absorb nitrogen in the nitrate form).

Biochar further gains from its porous nature, which gives it two very distinct utilities: (1) Carbon sequestration i.e. absorption of carbon from the atmosphere: the pores increase the surface area thereby allowing it absorb more carbon through its surface and (2) Colonization of various bacteria and fungi: Bacteria called diazotrophs and a few species of Fungi are able to colonise. Bacteria increases the nitrates content in the soil and fungi aids in disease management. Biochar further directly increases the phosphorous content by increasing the cationic and anionic activity of the soil.

In all, biochar not just presents itself as a substitute for stubble burning which can help cut down on the negative impacts of such activity, it qualitatively benefits the soil quality, increases the crop productivity and gives valuable by-products in its manufacturing cycle. The challenge, however, with the production, usage and supply chain management of biochar remains the cost competitiveness of the product. Central and State Governments need to reallocate resources, to make it available to its immediate consumers.

An acre of land needs about 4 to 4.5 tonnes of Biochar yearly and in today’s market costs Rs 18 per kg. This totals up to an annual investment of Rs 75,000 for an average Indian farmer who owns about an acre of land. Perhaps, what is required is a trifecta of subsidies, awareness programmes and an innovative machinery from the technical sector so that it could be produced by the consumers directly.

30% reduction in air pollution in city due to collective efforts: Rai,"October 26, 2022 01:38 am | Updated 11:42 am IST - New Delhi:

There has been a 30% reduction in air pollution in the city this year on the day after Deepavali compared with last year, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Tuesday.

He also said the number of stubble-burning incidents in AAP-ruled Punjab on the day of Deepavali had reduced to one-third compared with last year (from 3,032 to 1,091), but the same had increased in BJP-governed Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The BJP, however, refuted the claim, saying the Delhi government was “going all out to cover up for its sister government in Punjab for its failure to curb stubble burning in the State”.

Explained | Delhi-NCR’s revised action plan ‘GRAP’ to fight air pollution

Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal said the results of efforts made by the citizens of Delhi to reduce air pollution were encouraging. “Delhiites are working hard in the field of pollution. There have been very encouraging results. But there is still a long way to go. Will make Delhi the best city in the world,” Mr. Kejriwal added.

Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri challenged Mr. Kejriwal's claim that pollution had reduced in Delhi. “Delhi is the most polluted capital of the world, and this truth cannot be denied,” he said, adding, “Delhi was ranked as the world's most polluted capital on Deepavali and remained in the top 10 on Tuesday as well. Mr. Kejriwal should prove his claim right or else resign for lying. If my claim is false, I will quit.”

150 anti-smog guns

Mr. Rai said the pollution level in Delhi was the lowest in many years because of the collective efforts of everyone. The Minister also launched 150 mobile anti-smog guns, which are machines mounted on trucks that spray water to reduce dust pollution.

“Last year, we deployed 10 mobile anti-smog guns on roads and it had a positive impact. Keeping that in mind, we are deploying 150 mobile anti-smog guns this year,” he said.

Every day, each mobile anti-smog gun will spray water on a 10 km stretch of road.

Punjab vs BJP States

Mr. Rai said the Punjab government had made significant efforts to reduce cases of stubble burning.

""As per data, Haryana had 228 and Uttar Pradesh had 123 cases of stubble burning on the day of Deepavali last year. As per the figures released yesterday, in Haryana, there were 250 cases, which means that the number of incidents has increased on this year’s Deepavali. Uttar Pradesh also saw a rise in cases, as there were 215 reported incidents on Deepavali day,” he said.

In response, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Environment Minister Gopal Rai has been looking after the department for the last couple of years and must be knowing that the wind-blowing pattern is such that stubble burning in Punjab affects Delhi much more than that in Haryana, while U.P. burning has no effects on Delhi's AQI level.”

He also said that Delhi and Punjab Chief Ministers have met “a 100 times” in the past six-seven months for political meetings but never sat together to find a solution to the problem of stubble burning.",[],2022-10-25 20:08:21+00:00,https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/1k3750/article66054870.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/NDBL-7-25-10-22.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
"Hatsun Agro to Increase Milk Collection in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra","HAP plans to position further its milk collection centres at remote locations to ensure farmers have access to the facility and help them reap the real benefit of having access to such a facility in their own village thereby providing them with market access leading to prosperity to our rural sector.

Hatsun Agro Product Ltd.(HAP), a leading private sector dairy company in India, with brands ‘Arokya’, ‘Hatsun’, ‘Arun Icecreams’ has announced its procurement expansion plans in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. HAP has over 3100 milk collection centres that benefit farmers across various villages in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. HAP plans to aggressively expand this network of milk collection centres in these three states to effectively serve over 1 lakh farmers.

HAP plans to position further its milk collection centres at remote locations to ensure farmers have access to the facility and help them reap the real benefit of having access to such a facility in their own village thereby providing them with market access leading to prosperity to our rural sector.

Hatsun Agro Product Ltd procures 100% of the milk directly from farmers and has heavily invested in procurement infrastructure over the years to effectively handle a significant volume of milk.

HAP is India’s first dairy company to work on increasing farmer income by reducing the cost of production. The company has been collaborating at the university level to commercialize its high-yielding, protein-rich hybrid Napier green fodder (kambu/bajra) such as Co-4 and Co-5.

Many of HAP’s farmers have halved the cost of feeding their cows by cultivating Co-4 and Co-5 hybrid fodder. By using cow dung as manure, brush-cutters to save harvesting labour, rain guns to cut water consumption and milking machines, labour costs have been reduced significantly.

"Now that AAP rules both 'culprit' and 'victim' states, who will it blame for stubble burning?","The widespread post-harvest practice of burning paddy-crop stubble in Punjab and Haryana is a major contributor to air pollution in north India, particularly in Delhi, in October and November.

The season of farm fires has begun. This is an annual occurrence that in the past witnessed the Delhi's Aam Adami Party (AAP) government accusing its Punjab counterpart of doing precious little to dissuade the state farmers from carrying out the pernicious practice.

This year, however, the AAP will have to stop the blame game and focus on remedial measures instead. For, Arvind Kejriwal's party is ruling in both the 'culprit' and the 'victim' states—Punjab and Delhi.

AAP had promised to address the stubble burning issue during the campaigning for Punjab assembly polls this year. National capital Delhi, which is also ruled by AAP, is its biggest victim as the fumes from the crops' residue engulf the mega city every year, resulting in an alarming spike in air pollution levels, particularly in October and November.

Awareness drive planned

The Punjab government has prepared an elaborate plan involving a massive awareness drive, distribution of thousands of crop residue management machines, and engaging students and religious places to fight paddy stubble burning during the upcoming harvest season.

The AAP-led Punjab and Delhi governments had earlier proposed to give a cash subsidy of Rs 2,500 per acre — Rs 1,500 by the Centre and the rest borne by the two states — to farmers for not burning stubble. However, the Centre turned down the proposal.

Now the resource-strapped Punjab government is left with its own device to mitigate the harmful impact of stubble burning on Delhi citizens.

Punjab Agriculture Director Gurwinder Singh has said that a massive awareness drive is being launched in villages to motivate farmers not to burn paddy stubble. Around 2,800 camps in villages across the state are planned to dissuade farmers from burning the crop residue.

180 MT paddy straw is generated

Punjab generates around 180 lakh tonnes of paddy straw annually. Of 180 lakh MT of paddy stubble, 48 per cent is managed through in-situ and ex-situ (used as fuel) while the rest of the residue is set on fire. Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue so that the field is ready for the next Rabi crop (wheat).

Punjab recorded 71,304 cases of stubble burning in 2021, 76,590 in 2020, 55,210 in 2019, and 50,590 in 2018 with many districts including Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda, and Amritsar witnessing a large number of such incidents.

Under the awareness plan, mobile vans will be rolled out in villages with a message of stubble management. Daily announcements against the burning of residue have also been planned from gurdwaras, temples, and common places.

Wary of punitive action

The Punjab government has deputed around 10,000 officials and employees in the state to monitor stubble burning. The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Adarshpal Vig said the data on paddy straw burning has been shared with the district officials concerned.

However, the government is wary of taking any punitive action against the farmers caught burning stubbles. It will instead concentrate on persuasion.

Sukhdev Singh Kokri, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), said, ""We don't encourage stubble burning, but we will oppose the government if it registers cases against farmers. We are against any action against the farmers, who are already facing distress because of rising input costs.""

Use of machines and technology

The Punjab government has set a target of distributing 32,100 crop residue management machines this year. The government has allocated funds worth Rs 452 crore for giving crop residue management (CRM) machines as a subsidy to farmers.

Punjab's agricultural department is also planning to launch an 'i-Khet' app which will provide details of the availability of CRM machines and will facilitate farmers to book them on rent. In the past four seasons (2018-19 till 2021-22), the Centre provided a subsidy of Rs 935 crore for 90,422 CRM machines to Punjab.

Earlier this month, the AAP governments in Punjab and Delhi joined hands to combat stubble burning by spraying Pusa bio-decomposer on 5,000 acres in Punjab as a pilot project.

Fire counting begins

According to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which follows the standard protocol notified by the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM), 139 fire counts have already been recorded in Punjab from September 15 to September 26.

Stubble-burning at present is mostly happening in two districts of Punjab, Amritsar and Tarn Taran. Farmers usually plant wheat after harvesting paddy, but Amritsar and Tarn Taran are part of the potato belt. Farmers in these two districts harvest paddy early for potato farming.

Stubble-burning stops in Punjab and Haryana by November 25. However, it continues in other places such as east UP till December.

Gufran Beig, founder and project director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), said, ""As fire counts are low in number, farm fires have not impacted Delhi's air quality. Fire counts are expected to rise from October 10, when around 100 incidents would be recorded in a day. The practice usually peaks in the first week of November, when the daily count touches 5,000-6,000.""",['Rakesh Dixit'],2022-09-28 15:09:24+05:30,https://media.news9live.com/h-upload/2022/09/28/563664-stubbleburningafpn.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
Stubble burning ban not judicially amenable,"SC says genuine solution should be found, but prohibition not way

The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday declined to grant an urgent hearing on a plea seeking a ban on stubble burning as a measure to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR.

A counsel mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud.

The CJI remarked, “Will the ban (against stubble burning) help?” He added that in some matters, courts can look into and some it cannot since they are not judicially amenable.

The counsel suggested that banning stubble burning can be effective in curbing air pollution, which impacts Delhi-NCR.

The bench then queried “should we enforce it against every farmer in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh?” It added that some genuine solution should be found but this is not the way.

The top court declined to list the matter on priority.

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to examine a plea seeking urgent steps to curb air pollution in Delhi. The plea claimed due to worsening air pollution it has become difficult to survive in the National Capital Territory.

Advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha mentioned the matter before a bench headed by then Chief Justice U.U. Lalit, and sought an urgent hearing in the matter.

Jha said the air pollution in the capital is in the severe category due to increase in stubble burning and sought a direction to state governments to take necessary measures in order to reduce the pollution, which includes installation of smog-towers, plantation drive, affordable public transport, among others.

He said Verbio Group has strong association with the state as its Indian subsidiary Verbio India Private Ltd is the largest biofuel (Biomethane/Bio-CNG) production units in India with 33 TPD (tons per day) and 550 TPD per year of Bio-CNG capacity, adding that this Bio-CNG project will produce biogas by anaerobic digestion process and is a great way to solve the problem of stubble burning.

Mann said the annual straw consumption in this unit will be 1.30 lakh ton, adding that it will help in solving the vex problem of paddy straw burning.

He said that set up over an area of 20 acres of land, this unit will contribute to an annual reduction of 1.50 lakh metric ton of pollutants and 20,000 MT of fly ash currently produced due to paddy straw burning.

He further said this unit will also give employment to 1,000 youth and affect more than 5,000 families. Mann said that the acreage of soil enriched from biomanure will be 2,150 acres.

The Chief Minister further said that the Verbio group has evinced keen interest in setting up more such plants in the state. Once successful, the verbio group will set up 10 more such plants in the state.

Union Minister for Labour, Employment and Environment Bhupender Yadav expressed the confidence that the BJP will win the Munugode bypoll with a big majority and also the Assembly polls later to form a democratic and people’s government by the ‘lotus’ (BJP symbol) on Wednesday.

“People of Telangana are yearning for a change as the objective for which the separate state has been formed remains unfulfilled. This was discernible during my last visit to the constituency and also from the response to our TS party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s ‘padayatra’. Let Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao try anything, we are going to win,” he maintained.

Mr. Yadav was talking to the media after formally admitting former TRS MP B. Narasaiah Goud into the party in the presence of Union Minister for Tourism, Culture and Development of Northeast region G.

The Union Minister claimed that the Narendra Modi Government has been taking the country on the development path with vision and transparency to ensure the benefits reach the villages but in TS it stops at ‘one house’. “It is clear the TRS regime is not only corrupt but also dictatorial with no regard to democratic principles. The Dalit Bandhu scheme is limited to TV advertisements while the government sits on preparing the OBC student beneficiaries list,” he charged.

Dr. Goud said he believed in working for the people’s welfare and development with honesty. “I am influenced by the PM’s mission of development for all.

RSS affiliate opposes complete ban on firecrackers in Delhi,"New Delhi: Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM), the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, on Saturday strongly opposed a complete ban on firecrackers in the national capital during Diwali, terming it “inappropriate” and “hurtful” to Hindus.

Slamming the Arvind Kejriwal-led government, the manch asserted that the ban also dealt a blow to the employment of millions of workers and others engaged in the production and distribution of fire crackers across the country.

It urged the other state governments to avoid a complete ban on firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali, bypassing the false propaganda in terms of ill effects of firecrackers. For some time, without any factual information, governments have been taking action like banning all types of firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali, which is completely inappropriate and unscientific and an attack on the sentiments of people,” it said.

“We need to know that pollution caused by firecrackers was primarily due to illegally imported firecrackers from China and not the green crackers of India. It’s notable that there has been pollution due to the mixing of potassium nitrate and sulfur in Chinese firecrackers. However, in green (pollution-free) firecrackers made in India, potassium nitrate and sulfur are not mixed and other pollutants such as aluminium, lithium, arsenic and mercury etc. have been reduced to the minimum,” said Ashwani Mahajan, All India Co Convenor, SJM said.

These green firecrackers are certified by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. It’s scientifically proven that green crackers cause 30 per cent less pollution, he added.

Since the Union government has imposed an effective ban on Chinese firecrackers, it is completely unfair to impose a blanket ban on all types of firecrackers on Diwali on the occasion of Delhi.

“We should not forget that in Tamil Nadu (Sivakasi), West Bengal and several other parts of the country, the livelihoods of more than one million people depend on the firecracker industry. Throughout the year, these people wait for Deepawali to sell their firecrackers. In such a situation, it is not prudent to ban green firecrackers without any scientific basis which are much less polluting,” he added.

The SJM said that it is a matter of great regret that government agencies have failed to solve the problem of stubble burning in various parts of the country including Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. It’s proven without doubt that stubble burning remains the biggest source of air pollution in the national capital and surrounding northern states, and on the occasion of Diwali they try to misguide people, by focusing on banning firecrackers, diverting attention from the real cause of pollution.

Swadeshi Jagran Manch also urged all state governments to make efforts to find a permanent solution to the problem of stubble burning.",['Indo-Asian News Service'],2022-10-22 07:08:50+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Firecrackers.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Munugode', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"

Paddy trucks from Andhra denied entry into Telangana,"With authorities in Telangana commencing paddy procurement from farmers, trucks with paddy coming from Andhra Pradesh were denied entry into the state on Friday. Several paddy-laden trucks were stopped at the checkposts on the inter-state border.

Trucks were seen queued up at Dachepalli checkpost in Palnadu district as they were denied entry. The truck drivers said they were stopped though they have all the relevant documents for transport of paddy.

Telangana officials told the truck drivers that they will not be allowed till procurement of paddy from local farmers is completed.

Truck drivers said they had no prior information and this was causing them severe inconvenience.

The officials have made it clear that paddy being brought from Andhra Pradesh will not be procured in Telangana.

Amid a stand-off with the Centre, the Telangana Cabinet on Tuesday decided to procure paddy from farmers during the ongoing Rabi season. Procurement centres have been opened in several villages over the last two days.

Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamalakar has already stated that 51 checkposts have been set up on the border to stop paddy-laden trucks from entering the state.

With the Centre refusing to procure paddy from Telangana farmers and insisting on raw rice, the state government on Tuesday decided to procure paddy from farmers.

The decision was taken a day after Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao, who had led a protest in Delhi on Monday demanding the Centre to procure the entire paddy.

The government will pay Rs 1,960 for every quintal of paddy. The money will be directly credited to the bank accounts of farmers.

KCR, as the Chief Minister is popularly known, appealed to farmers not to sell the paddy at less than Minimum Support Price (MSP). He assured farmers that the state government will procure every grain though it may suffer a loss of Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 3,500 crore.

During Rabi season, paddy cultivation was taken up in Telangana on 35.84 lakh acres, the highest in the country. Andhra Pradesh stands at distant second at 16.68 lakh acre.

Don’t use martyrs to further your political ambitions: Revanth to KCR,"September 01, 2022 07:49 pm | Updated 07:49 pm IST - Hyderabad

Telangana Congress president A. Revanth Reddy has charged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao with using the sacrifices of martyrs for spreading his political ambitions.

“This reflected the way martyrs in Telangana are ignored while the CM went to Bihar to distributes cheques to martyrs from that State,” he said.

In an open letter to the CM, he said that M. Yadaiah, a martyr from Kondareddipalle village in Vangur mandal in combined Mahabubangar district, fell to the bullets of terrorists in Kashmir but the government has not kept its promise of providing monetary compensation, a house and five acres of agricultural land apart from a job to a family member.

He said that K. Kavitha, MLC and daughter of the Chief Minister, also visited the family but nothing has been provided to them in the last nine years.

Mr. Reddy said that the way KCR made his Bihar visit completely political and a platform to further his national political ambitions, showed he was using the sacrifices of our soldiers to promote himself. “Telangana society is surprised with the way you are distributing money to martyrs of another State while ignoring the same in Telangana,” he said.

He advised the Chief Minister not to ‘stoop to such low’ just to promote himself at the cost of the State and its interests.

Delhi govt bans firecrackers again till January 1,"New Delhi: There will be a blanket ban on the production, sale and use of all types of firecrackers in the national capital, including on Diwali, till January 1, 2023, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Wednesday.

Rai said the ban extends to online sale of firecrackers. He, however, did not clarify when the restrictions will come into force.

“Production, storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers are being completely banned so that people’s lives can be saved,” he tweeted.

This time there will also be a ban on the online sale and delivery of firecrackers in Delhi. The restriction will remain in force till January 1, 2023.

“Online sale/delivery of firecrackers will also be banned in Delhi this time. The restriction will remain in force till January 1, 2023,” Rai said.

The minister said an action plan will be drawn up with the Delhi Police, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and Revenue Department to ensure strict enforcement of the ban.

BJP leader Kapil Mishra said the Arvind Kejriwal government has failed to curb air pollution in Delhi and is now “showing off” by banning firecrackers.

“It has been proved in scientific reports and the court that firecrackers are not the source of pollution. When the Kejriwal government has failed to stop pollution in Delhi, why show off by banning firecrackers?” he tweeted in Hindi.

Last year, the Delhi government had announced a complete ban on firecrackers till January 1, 2022. It also ran an aggressive campaign against the sale and use of firecrackers which involved 15 special teams at the district level.

Neighbouring Haryana also imposed a ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in 14 of its districts in the National Capital Region (NCR), while Uttar Pradesh allowed the use of green crackers on Diwali just for two hours in areas with moderate or better air quality.

Despite the restrictions, people burst firecrackers till late night in Delhi, Noida, Faridabad and Gurugram.

Fireworks had led to major changes in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi on Diwali night (November 4), according to the DPCC.

Emissions from firecrackers and farm fires had pushed the capital’s 24-hour average air quality index for the day after Diwali to 462, the highest in five years.

Rai had then alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instigated people to flout the ban on firecrackers on Diwali by linking it to religion.

The National Green Tribunal on December 2, 2020 had ordered a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the NCR and all cities with poor or worse ambient air quality.

The air quality in Delhi and neighbouring areas start worsening in October due to unfavourable meteorological factors such as low temperatures and wind speed which do not allow dispersion of pollutants.

A cocktail of emissions from firecrackers on Diwali and stubble burning in neighbouring states makes it worse.

A study led by researchers from IIT-Delhi says that biomass burning emissions, rather than fireworks, drive the poor air quality in the national capital during the days following Diwali.

On Diwali day, stubble burning accounted for 25 per cent of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi in 2021; 32 per cent in 2020 and 19 per cent in 2019, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality forecaster SAFAR.",['Press Trust Of India'],2022-09-07 11:42:38+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Firecrackers.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Munugode', 'Koheda', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"

KCR also took aim at Piyush Goyal, claiming that the Union Minister reacted ""harshly"" when the state Agriculture Minister met with him.

""Piyush Goyal, our agriculture minister, reacted angrily when he arrived in Delhi. Goyal instructed him to consume broken rice. I'm not sure what Piyush Goyal understands, but he's Piyush Golmaal,"" he stated.

Hyderabad: It has not been long since cheetahs were reintroduced in India -- seven decades since they faced It has not been long since cheetahs were reintroduced in India -- seven decades since they faced extinction in the country. A similar mission is reportedly nearing completion in Telangana, where forest officials are trying to protect and breed the Indian spotted Chevrotain (Moschiola indica), commonly called mouse deer

The project to reintroduce mouse deer to Telangana's Amrabad Tiger Reserve (ATR) is nearing completion, The New Indian Express (TNIE) said in a report. It was in 2017 that the Telangana Forest Department decided to reintroduce mouse-deer to the forests within the state territory. The species that once roamed the forests of Telangana is said to have suffered local extinction over the years.

How did they disappear?

The population of nocturnal mammals in Telangana gradually fell until they nearly disappeared due to increased poaching and threat to habitat. Their tiny size made them easy prey to hunters, TNIE quoted wildlife experts as saying.

What changed?

The forest department swung into action as the animal plays a vital role in the food chain as well as the ecological balance. Mouse deer droppings aid seed dispersal and thereby replenishes the forest vegetation. They are also a food source to several carnivorous species including leopards, eagles and hyenas, the news report said.

Were the mouse deer brought from a foreign country?

No. Six including four females and two males were bred at Hyderabad's Nehru Zoological Park. Before the project began, a pilot study was conducted in Pichakuntla Cheruvu --an undisturbed area with a perennial water supply. The animals were gradually released into an enclosure covering 2.14 hectares and equipped with a solar fence and CCTV cameras to monitor the animals.

How are they being reintroduced?

Since the initiative began, 17 batches of mouse deer have been released into the wild habitat to date, the daily said. The programme will come to an end when a total of 250 mouse deer have been released into the wild. The last batches were released in a 3:1 male-to-female ratio, TNIE said.

The programme is carried out as per the guidelines of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While the initial objective was to stabilise its population by ensuring ample food in limited area, the department later switched to the acclimatisation phase in which the food distribution was brought down to the minimum. Then came the pre-release phase in which the feeding activity was completely stopped. This was to familiarise them with the way of the wild so that they won't suffer later.",[],2022-10-12 13:25:01+05:30,"https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-94805781,imgsize-100,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/94805781.jpg",[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Munugode', 'Koheda', 'Amrabad', 'Warangal', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad']"
"We are seeking votes based on performance, says KTR","October 20, 2022 10:01 pm | Updated October 21, 2022 09:37 am IST - HYDERABAD

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president and Minister K.T. Rama Rao said they were seeking votes in Munugode byelection based on the last eight years’ performance in the State and wanted to know on what basis the BJP had been seeking votes. He alleged that both BJP and Congress had joined hands and become one to defeat the TRS in the byelection.

Alair former MLA B. Bhikshamaiah resigned from the BJP and joined the TRS in the presence of Mr. Rama Rao, and Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy at Telangana Bhavan on Thursday evening.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Rama Rao came down heavily on both BJP and Congress, saying the BJP had been trying to play money politics in the byelection. “We have addressed the fluoride problem in the district, offering safe drinking water to every house, taken up irrigation projects and are moving forward with development and welfare schemes. Let the BJP tell people what it had done to Telangana and public,” said Mr. Rama Rao adding that BJP had been doing politics using constitutional bodies as a shield.

“The results of Huzurnagar and Nagarjunasagar will surely repeat in Munugode and we are confident that people will vote for TRS. I request the voters to be careful and vote as the result of this election will have an impact on the future of Telangana,” warned Mr. Rama Rao. Stating that funds were not sanctioned even after fluorosis patients were taken to late prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he wanted to know why Prime Minister Narendra Modi had failed to release funds. He was also surprised on how a small company run by Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy was able to get contract worth thousands of crores of rupees.

Referring to Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy, the TRS working president said that the Union Minister was innocent and his stature was limited to inaugurating lifts at railway stations whereas Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was with the stature of inaugurating Kaleshwaram project.

Hyderabad man sets bike on fire when cop stops him for riding on wrong side,"A man set his motorcycle on fire when a traffic police constable stopped him for riding on the wrong side on the busy streets of Ameerpet in Hyderabad Monday evening, said the police. The incident at Maitrivanam junction led to a brief stoppage of traffic on the stretch, they added.

According to police, S Ashok, who runs a mobile phone shop in the area, picked up an argument with the traffic policeman as he was stopped. He went inside his shop to get a bottle of fuel, poured it on the bike and set it on fire, said the police.

AV Ranganath, joint commissioner of police (traffic), stated that the motorist was commuting in the wrong direction and causing inconvenience to the right of way of traffic when he was stopped at pillar No. 1053. “Hyderabad Traffic Police is enforcing traffic laws for the safety of commuters and acting strictly against the commuters who are not following the traffic rules and driving their vehicles in an endangering manner which may lead to road fatalities,” he said in a release.

Operation ROPE: 472 booked, Rs 3.65 lakh fine imposed

Meanwhile, Hyderabad traffic police Monday started a special drive – ROPE (Removal of obstructive parking encroachments) and imposed a fine of Rs 3.65 lakh on 472 motorists, and 18 shops and establishments for traffic violations. City police commissioner CV Anand who inspected the special drive told reporters that more such special drives would be taken up to keep a check on traffic violations, including triple riding, cell phone riding, wrong-side driving etc and bring order on the roads.

Anand urged the public representatives to cooperate with the traffic police during enforcement and VIP movements. He appealed to the public to utilise the public transport systems instead of personal vehicles, a collective action that would reduce the congestion on roads.

All the establishment owners were being sensitised to keep the carriageway clear by providing park space, he said while stressing that commuters must stop when the signal turns green to orange.

"First Time In Country, TS Records Crop Diversification Patterns in The Form of Index","According to the crop diversification index, the state grows 77 varieties, with roughly 10 crops, predominantly grains, preferred for diversification.

Telangana has started documenting crop diversification trends in the form of an index for the first time in the country, following the paddy procurement row with the Centre and the state government asking farmers to opt for alternate crops.

According to the crop diversification index, the state grows 77 varieties, with roughly 10 crops, predominantly grains, favored for diversification. In the state, Nirmal, Vikarabad, and Sangareddy are more diverse.

It was also discovered that Peddapalli, Karimnagar, and Suryapet were the three least diverse areas. Surprisingly, in these regions where paddy farming is common, the maize cropping area has declined dramatically while the cotton cropping area has expanded. According to state officials, the score will serve as a benchmark for future agricultural diversification in the state.

The index has a starting value of one. It represents the proportion of total cultivated area devoted to a single crop. Many districts in the state have index values ranging from 0 to 5, and the higher the score, the greater the agricultural diversification.

The current index was calculated using the area under 77 different crops, along with all food, non-food, and cash crops, and also the area under floriculture.

It was also discovered that, after conventional paddy and maize, pulses were the most preferred crops in the state.

Following paddy, farmers prioritized wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, green gram, black gram, red gram, Bengal gram, cow gram, and chilies.

""Before the increase in paddy crop production, farmers to grow a large variety of pulses and other food crops."" ""The same pattern must now be expanded,"" agricultural department officials stated.

""Looking at the index numbers, there is a greater need for diversification,"" they stated.

Crop diversification efforts have resulted in a 77.9% reduction in maize area from 9.7 lakh acres in 2019-20 (in Vaanakalam) to 2.1 lakh acres in 2020-21.

Cotton acreage climbed by 10.9 percent during the same time, from 52.6 lakh to 58.3 lakh acres, while red gram acreage grew by 45.1 percent, from 7.3 lakh to 10.6 lakh acres.",[],None,https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/64743/regenerative-agricultur.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Alair', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Munugode', 'Koheda', 'Amrabad', 'Nirmal', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nalgonda', 'Warangal', 'Medak', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nirmal', 'Nalgonda', 'Medak']"
"3-Day Dairy and Food Expo Kicked Off at Hitex, Telangana","It is jointly hosted by the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) and Media Day Marketing (MDM). It is the first-ever show on the subject after the formation of the Telangana state.

Mohd Mahmood Ali, Home Minister and Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries, Government of Telangana inaugurated the three-day Dairy and Food Expo at Hitex, Madhapur on Friday morning. It will be concluded on Sunday, 10th April.

It is jointly hosted by the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) and Media Day Marketing (MDM). It is the first-ever show on the subject after the formation of the Telangana state.

More than 100 Exhibitors and 120 brands are displaying their products, technologies and services at the show. It is also showcasing the latest technologies, New Players, Processing & Packaging Machinery, Supply Chain Management and Allied Industries in the Dairy and Food Sector. The B2B event is also open to the general public from 10 am to 6 pm on all three days.

Minister T Srinivas Yadav urged the industry to produce more milk to meet the demand for it in the city. Milk is an essential commodity. The Vijaya Dairy which was speculated to be closed down before the TRS party came into power is now making fast strides. It is now doing well and achieved a turnover of over Rs 650 crore and we are targeting Rs 1000core.

Responding to the challenges and bottlenecks being faced by the Dairy industry as raised by K. Bhaskar Reddy FTCCI President, Minister T. Srinivas Yadav suggested having a preliminary meeting with the Director of Animal Husbandry and subsequently with him to resolve them.

Addressing the gathering immediately after inaugurating it Mohd Mahamood Ali, Home Minister said what farmers need is power and water, which is available abundantly in Telangana state, unlike in the past before the bifurcation of the state. I am being a Diary Farm owner, I know that we are unable to meet the milk demand of the city.

Hyderabad is known for Irani Chai and Biryani. People drink tea at least 5 to 6 times a day and they prefer buffalo milk. We can meet just 30% of the milk demand in the city and the rest is imported from Maharashtra and Karnataka.

We must become self-sufficient in Milk production, he said. He added that Telangana is the only state to have Mobile veterinary clinics

Speaking on the occasion Dr. S. Ramchander, Director of Animal Husbandry, Govt of Telangana said the Government of Telangana recognized the animal husbandry sector as a priority area. Animal husbandry plays a significant role in the nutritional security of the masses. The livestock sector employs 8.8% population.

The milk production of Telangana has grown from 42.07 LMT in 2014 to 57.65 LMT in the year 2020-2021. Telangana contributes approximately 3.0% of India’s total milk production with a 9.1 % annual growth rate of milk production against the national average of 6.5%. Despite being the world’s largest milk producer, only 12 to 15 % of the milk is delivered to the dairies for processing as against the world average of 70 %

Speaking about opportunities in Telangana Dr. S. Ramchander said a strong Veterinary health care network with 2100 veterinary hospitals 1200 qualified Veterinarians 2000 para veterinarians across the state to cater the animal health care in the state.

100 Mobile veterinary clinics rendering the Emergency services at farmer’s doorstep on call of toll-free 1962 no. TS Govt is spending 40 crores/ annum

Welcoming the gathering earlier K. Bhaskar Reddy, President of FTCCI raised problems and bottlenecks the dairy industry is facing. While the city needs 35 lakh liters of milk, we are able to procure only 12 lakh liters. He expressed displeasure about the sporadic procurement of milk.

The help, support, and funds supposed to come from National Dairy Promotion and Research Board is also not materializing due to the strained relationships with the state and centre. In conjunction with the expo knowledge sharing sessions are being organized. FTCCI organized a session on Milking Dairy Opportunities with a focus on Production, Quality, Innovations and Packaging technologies.",[],None,https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/67667/mahmood-ali-seen-being-welcomed-at-dairy-and-food-expo.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Alair', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Munugode', 'Koheda', 'Amrabad', 'Nirmal', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nalgonda', 'Warangal', 'Medak', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nirmal', 'Nalgonda', 'Medak']"

"70 Acres, 5 Crore Trees: This Telangana Man Has Built a Forest of his Own","A man from a small village built an entire forest on his own consisting of various species of flora and fauna.

In the district of Suryapet, a man turned a 70-acre land into a forest all by himself. The forest has approximately 32 different varieties of birds, animals, and about 5 crore different kinds of trees. There is no fencing and gate around the forest. The forest has seven ponds, the lotus pond being the most popular among them.

The Forest Owner: Dusharla Satyanarayan

The owner of the forest, Durshala Satyanarayan, wants to add at least 3 more ponds in his forest.

Satyanarayan has been a nature lover since his childhood days. He spent his entire life taking care of his forest in the Raghavapuram village. The owner does not intend to give away his land to his two children. He believes that the forest belongs to the animals and birds that are living in it. The land on which the forest is built has been passed from generation to generation in his family.

The forest that Satyanarayan has built has a very high market value. Even though, Satyanarayan does not even think about selling his land and believes that even money cannot buy a whole forest. He has been raising and preserving this forest for over 60 decades.

When Satyanarayan was a child, a man broke the branch of a tree to let his cattle graze upon it. Satyanarayana saw this whole incident and hit the man in order to protest against the breaking of the tree branch. The man complained to his father, to which his father said that it is his son's nature to protect nature.

Satyanarayan did his bachelor's in the field of agriculture. He later got a job in a Bank. He quit his bank job to work on water issues that have trapped the district of Nalgona. The forest that Satyanarayan created, has its eco-system. Trees are not removed, even if their branches fall off. The animals and birds residing in it help in the rejuvenation of the forest.",[],None,https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/66135/forest-2.jpeg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Alair', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Karimnagar', 'Munugode', 'Narayankhed', 'Koheda', 'Amrabad', 'Nirmal', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nalgonda', 'Warangal', 'Medak', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor']","['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nirmal', 'Nalgonda', 'Medak']"

We don’t want to add to air pollution: SC on Manoj Tiwari’s plea on firecracker ban,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the Delhi government’s order banning storage, sale, and use of all types of firecrackers till January 1, 2023 to check pollution levels in the national capital.

A bench of Justices M R Shah and Krishna Murari expressed concern over pollution levels during Diwali.

“You’re a permanent resident of NCR, right? Have you seen the pollution? We do not want to add to the pollution. We are not dismissing your plea, we will consider it,” the bench told advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha, appearing for BJP MP Manoj Tiwari.

The lawyer insisted in the court that the air pollution was due to stubble burning.

The top court tagged the petition along with the main matter and said it will come up for hearing before Diwali.

Contending that freedom of religion cannot be taken away under the pretext of the right to life, Tiwari has also sought directions to all states not to take any coercive action like lodging FIR against common people found selling or using permissible firecrackers during the festival season including Diwali.

The top court had last year clarified there is no blanket ban on the use of firecrackers and only those fireworks which contain barium salts are prohibited.

The BJP MP, in his plea filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, has said several state governments and certain high courts had in 2021 passed orders contrary to the stand taken by the apex court and imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers.

“With so many different orders, directions and views, it was confusing for the people at large to understand whether the firecrackers were allowed or not despite this court’s refusal to put a blanket ban,” said in the plea.

“In the name of right to life, freedom of religion cannot be taken away and that a balance has to strike like that has been done through the decision of this court dated October 29, 2021,” it said.

The petition alleged that despite clear orders of the top court, certain states and Union Territories did not take necessary steps to ensure proper arrangements for the celebration of Diwali and instead registered FIRs and imposed curfew.

“The chief secretaries, police commissioners, police district superintendents, station house officers, and others in order to comply with the orders of their respective state governments have taken action against the common people who while purchasing the firecrackers did not even have knowledge about the ingredients of the crackers at all,” it said.

Tiwari’s plea said such arrests and FIRs sent out a “very bad message” to the society at large and unnecessarily created “fear and anger” among the masses.",['Press Trust Of India'],2022-10-10 17:17:59+00:00,https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sevgbrbhw.jpg,[],[],,"['Mahabubabad', 'Munugode', 'Amrabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Narayankhed', 'Jadcherla', 'Alair', 'Peddapalli', 'Nirmal', 'Krishna', 'Nalgonda', 'Warangal', 'Medak', 'Bela', 'Bhiknoor', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Koheda', 'Suryapet']","['Mahabubabad', 'Vikarabad', 'Sangareddy', 'Kamareddy', 'Adilabad', 'Karimnagar', 'Khammam', 'Rangareddy', 'Mahabubnagar', 'Hyderabad', 'Nizamabad', 'Peddapalli', 'Suryapet', 'Nirmal', 'Nalgonda', 'Medak']"
