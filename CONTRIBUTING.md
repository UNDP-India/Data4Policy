# Welcome to DiCRA contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!âœ¨

Read our Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable.
In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New Contributor guide
Familiarize yourself with the project's goals and objectives. Go through [ReadMe](https://github.com/shubhamcodez/dicra/blob/main/readme.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/shubhamcodez/dicra/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to better understand our expectations of standard and enforcement guidelines. 

#### For Technical contributions, 
<ul>
  <li>Install Python and relevant libraries. </li>
  <li>Preferably, set up a virtual environment. Using a virtual environment in Python can help to isolate dependencies, improve reproducibility, and enhance security by allowing you to install 
    and manage packages and dependencies needed for a specific project in a separate location from your global Python environment.</li>
</ul>

## Making Contributions
<ul>
<li>Submit contributions through pull requests: Pull requests allow you to propose changes to the codebase and have them reviewed by the project's maintainers and other contributors. To submit a pull request, first make sure that you have forked the repository and created a separate working branch for your changes. Then, push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request from your branch to the upstream repository. Be sure to include a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request, as well as any relevant issues or considerations.</li>
 <li>Consider opening an issue to discuss significant changes: If you are considering making significant changes to the codebase, it is a good idea to open an issue to discuss your proposed changes before creating a pull request. This will allow you to get feedback and input from the project's maintainers and other contributors, and can help ensure that your changes align with the project's goals and direction.
  </li>
<li> Follow coding standards and style guidelines: To help ensure that the codebase is consistent and easy to read, make sure to follow the project's coding standards and style guidelines. This may include things like using a specific indentation style, following naming conventions, and commenting your code to make it easier to understand.
  </li>
<li> Document new features and functionality: If you are adding new features or functionality to the codebase, make sure to document them thoroughly. This can include adding new sections to the documentation, as well as updating existing documentation to reflect the changes. Be sure to include brief comments and descriptions of your code to help other contributors understand how it works and how it fits into the overall project. </li>
<li>Adhere to the code of conduct: It is important to be respectful and considerate of others when interacting with the project and its community. Make sure to follow the repository's code of conduct to ensure that all interactions are positive and constructive. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to the project's maintainers or other community members for help or guidance. </li>
</ul>
