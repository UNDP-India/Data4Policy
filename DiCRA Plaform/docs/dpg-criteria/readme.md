## Digital Public Goods Alliance

The Digital Public Goods Alliance is a multi-stakeholder initiative with a mission to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals in low- and middle-income countries by facilitating the discovery, development, use of, and investment in digital public goods.

The Digital Public Goods Standard is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to maximise consensus about whether a digital solution conforms to the definition of a digital public good: open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm by design and are of high relevance for attainment of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This definition stems from the UN Secretary-Generalâ€™s [Roadmap for Digital Cooperation.](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/)

The DPG Standard establishes the baseline requirements that must be met in order to earn recognition as a digital public good (DPG). This standard is designed to complement other relevant principles such as the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/) and is applicable to DPGs in all sectors across the SDGs. The DPG Standard is itself an open project, open to contribution on [GitHub](https://github.com/DPGAlliance/DPG-Standard), and developed in collaboration with organisations and experts.
